## Description

{% hint style="danger" %}
This article describes the MapSwitcher extension for the Google Chrome browser and should not be confused with another tool of the same name for Firefox browser, developed by [Franti≈°ek Nesveda](https://addons.mozilla.org/mk/firefox/user/15224571/) which currently supports far fewer Map formats, does not work in the same way, and can be found here [https://addons.mozilla.org/mk/firefox/addon/map-switcher/](https://addons.mozilla.org/mk/firefox/addon/map-switcher/)
{% endhint %}

MapSwitcher is an extension for the Google Chrome browser, which can be downloaded from the [Google Chrome Store](https://app.gitbook.com/s/wj16aeUeCQ32BThaGKHz/). It aids Open Source research by assisting users to switch their focus of study from one geographical data app to another, whilst migrating the same location co-ordinates between apps. General aspect is also preserved as far as possible, i.e. zoom, direction, etc.

This benefits of MapSwitcher for Open Source research are mainly:

* **Accuracy:** Human error when handling copy and paste of system co-ordinates between apps is largely eliminated by using MapSwitcher
* **Efficiency:** Research work can be performed more quickly when transfer between apps is automated using MapSwitcher.
* **Quality:** Where MapSwitcher makes it easy for researchers to switch quickly and accurately between apps, they are more likely to check their work using more than one system, which generally leads to more accurate results.

{% hint style="info" %}
The list of different geographical data platforms which can be used with MapSwitcher is growing all the time. You can check the current status of any app you're interested in,  either from the extension itself if you have it installed, or here on the [Github page for MapSwitcher](https://github.com/david-r-edgar/MapSwitcher). The list as of May 2024 is show below as an example, but this will not remain definitive:
