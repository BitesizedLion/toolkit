# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
  "tags": [
    "instagram"
  ],
  "url": "https://instaloader.github.io",
  "cost": "Free"
}
```
{% endcode %}

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in light blue font) and do not change the key names (left side, slightly darker blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. You can validate your changes using a tool like [https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/) or [https://json-gui.esstudio.site/](https://json-gui.esstudio.site/)

See below for an explanation of each line.

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition". Seperate tags with a comma `,`.
