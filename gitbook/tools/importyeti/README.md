## Description

Every sea shipment into the United States requires a bill of lading. ImportYeti has acquired all the bill of lading data, from January 2015, through a freedom of information request to US Customs. ImportYeti provides free access to the data online. Bills of lading include fields like: Purchaser and supplier names, supplier country, weight of goods, ports shipped to and from, and product HS code. (The harmonised system is a set of codes for classifying traded products.)

The tool was built to help people to find suppliers of goods (eg manufacturers that make a product they want to sell). An OSINT researcher might use it to investigate sourcing of goods from unethical suppliers, or sanctions violations. The free search allows for searching by company name, supplier, or product. Note that you must search by company's legal name.

It's worth signing up (it's free), as ImportYeti requires a login after 25 page views per IP address. You might be able to get free access to ImportYeti's power query and downloads as an OSINT researcher - see [this page](https://www.importyeti.com/pricing/custom-plan?source=survey). Power query is an advanced search - it allows you to filter by multiple values at a time, e.g. company name, supplier name, product (HS) code, address, supplier country, vessel name etc.

Here are screenshots illustrating the kinds of data you can get through ImportYeti:
