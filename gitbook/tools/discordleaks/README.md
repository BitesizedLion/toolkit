# DiscordLeaks

## URL

## Description

Unicorn Riot, a media collective in the US, has had their reporters collect Discord, RocketChat and Skype chat logs in the course of their reporting on active hate groups throughout the world. The DiscordLeaks web app allows the public to sort through the collected information from Discord servers, giving open access to an archive of chat logs from various far-right groups.

## Cost

* [ ] Partially Free

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Web browser

## Limitations

This is not a comprehensive archive of all Discord servers, or even all far-right Discord servers, but a limited set of servers that Unicorn Riot journalists have accessed. Users can either browse by server, channel, or user, or search for specific information - either within a single server, or across all servers. However, the information is most relevant to users who know what (or who) they are looking for.

## Ethical Considerations

This is information that has been acquired from private servers that researchers have infiltrated. That said, it is all now available publicly via the Unicorn Riot website.
