## Description

Unicorn Riot reporters collect Discord chat logs and other documentation of racist and far-right organizing during our reporting on active hate groups, both in the U.S. and internationally.  The DiscordLeaks web app and other data releases, such as downloads of chat screenshots and HTML archives, allow concerned members of the public, as well as other media organizations and researchers, to read, search, and cross-reference leaked far-right organizing chats.

## Requirements

Web browser

## Limitations

Users can either browse by server, channel, or user, or search for specific information - either within a single server, or across all servers. However, the information is most relevant to users who know what (or who) they are looking for.

## Ethical Considerations

This is information that has been acquired from private servers that researchers have infiltrated. That said, it is all now available publicly via the Unicorn Riot website.
