**Advanced Search Through Web Browser**

Twitter/X’s Advanced Search makes it ideal for source investigations. It helps refine search queries and produces more subject matter-specific results. While the search interface is mostly self-explanatory, below is a description of each search field.&#x20;

**“All of these words”:**&#x20;

You can search for posts containing specific words, phrases, or hashtags.

Example: Amsterdam canals

This will show posts that mention  “Amsterdam” and “canals”

**“This exact phrase”** is similar to using quotation marks on search engines. It pulls up results for an exact match for a specific sequence of words.&#x20;

Example: best of both worlds&#x20;

This will generate results with this exact phrase.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is okay not to use quotation marks for this search parameter. If you do, they will generate the same results as without quotation marks.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Any of these words”:** A user can use this field to filter terms that contain one search term or another.&#x20;

Example: Amsterdam canals&#x20;

This will search for posts with either just “Amsterdam” or just “canals”&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can add OR between the search terms, and it will generate the same results&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Hashtags”:** Advanced Search allows you to filter your search further using hashtags. This is particularly useful for monitoring events in real-time.&#x20;

Example: If I want to search for content related to Myanmar but only want to focus on the June 3rd coup, I will enter “Myanmar” on the top field and “June3Coup” or “WhatsHappingInMyanmar” on the hashtag field. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users do not have to use the hash (#) symbol in the field, but the tool generates the same search if they choose to. (i.e. June3Coup or #June3Coup will generate the same results) &#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Language”:** Twitter Advanced Search allows you to zero in on posts in a specific language, refining your search for better results.

Example: If I am interested in learning about the farmers' protest in the EU, but only want to get results in Dutch, the  parameters may look like this:

TIP: Language and Search Terms

Twitter Advanced Search prioritizes your exact keywords during the search. This means:

* If you search for an English term but want results in Dutch, tweets containing the English word and Dutch text might appear.

Finding Local Content with Translation:

To focus on local content in a specific language:

1. Translate your keywords using Google Translate or DeepL.
2. Use the translated keywords in your Twitter Advanced Search.
{% endhint %}

**ACCOUNTS**

Find posts from specific accounts to specific accounts or mention specific accounts. This enables users to see the interaction or exchange between accounts. This is particularly useful for tracking disinformation/misinformation to see who has interacted with which content and whether or not those accounts agree or disagree with each other.&#x20;

These are the subfilters:&#x20;

**“From these accounts”** Searching for posts from \`@Iamsterdam\` will show posts posted by this account.

**“To these accounts.”** Searching for posts sent to @Iamsterdam will show posts in which other users mentioned or replied to @Iamsterdam.

**“Mentioning these accounts”** Searching for posts mentioning @Iamsterdam will show posts from other users that include the @Iamsterdam handle.

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: You can input more than one account
{% endhint %}

\
**“Filters”:** Refine your Twitter search! Advanced Search lets you choose whether to include replies, ensuring you see the full conversation or focus solely on original posts.

To see only original posts, deselect the "Replies" checkbox under "Account Filters" in Twitter Advanced Search.

**“Replies”:** One targeted feature is the ability to focus solely on replies. By excluding original posts, you can gain a deeper understanding of the ongoing discussion surrounding a particular topic.

This ability to isolate replies proves especially valuable in numerous areas. For instance:

* Sentiment Analysis: By analyzing replies, you can gauge the public's emotional response to a brand, product, or event.
* Tracking Opinions: Focusing on replies allows you to see what people are saying about a specific topic, revealing trends.&#x20;

**“Links”:** Twitter Advanced Search lets you refine your results even further. You can choose to see only posts containing links. This can be useful for finding content that references external sources.

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: This filter does not allow you to specify a specific website or URL. The search will simply include posts with any link, regardless of the domain.
{% endhint %}

**ENGAGEMENTS**

{% hint style="warning" %}
TIP: If you want to cut through the noise and discover the most popular posts on a topic? Twitter's "Top posts" tab might seem like the answer, but it doesn't always show the absolute most engaging content. [The "Top posts" algorithm considers various factors, making it unpredictable.](https://blog.x.com/engineering/en\_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm)
{% endhint %}

In Twitter Advanced Search, you can define your own criteria for engagement. Want to see posts with at least 1,000 likes or replies? Advanced Search lets you set precise thresholds for minimum likes, reposts, replies, or even a combination of these metrics. This way, you'll get a clear picture of the most engaging posts that meet your specific requirements.

You can set your own parameters for the following subfields:

**“Minimum replies”**

**“Minimum Likes”**

**“Minimum reposts”**&#x20;

This granular control ensures the retrieval of posts that demonstrably resonate with a significant portion of the user base.

## Limitations

If a user changes their handle, the [Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) tool won't return tweets under the new handle that were posted under the old handle, but searching for tweets under the old handle still works.
