### _**Advanced Search Through Web Browser**_

&#x20;**WORDS**

Twitter/X’s Advanced Search makes it ideal for source investigations. It helps refine search queries and produces more subject matter-specific results. While the search interface is mostly self-explanatory, below is a description of the search fields, and some tips.&#x20;

**“All of these words”:** You can search for posts containing specific words, phrases, or hashtags.

Example: Amsterdam canals

This will show posts that mention  “Amsterdam” and “canals”

**“This exact phrase”:** is similar to using quotation marks on search engines. It pulls up results for an exact match for a specific sequence of words.&#x20;

Example: best of both worlds&#x20;

This will generate results with this exact phrase.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is okay not to use quotation marks for this search parameter. If you do, they will generate the same results as without quotation marks.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Any of these words”:** A user can use this field to filter terms that contain one search term or another.&#x20;

Example: Amsterdam canals&#x20;

This will search for posts with either just “Amsterdam” or just “canals”&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can add OR between the search terms, and it will generate the same results&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Hashtags”:** Advanced Search allows you to filter your search further using hashtags. This is particularly useful for monitoring events in real-time.&#x20;

Example: If I want to search for content related to Myanmar but only want to focus on the June 3rd coup, I will enter “Myanmar” on the top field and “June3Coup” or “WhatsHappingInMyanmar” on the hashtag field. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users do not have to use the hash (#) symbol in the field, but the tool generates the same search if they choose to. (i.e. June3Coup or #June3Coup will generate the same results) &#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Language”:** Twitter Advanced Search allows you to zero in on posts in a specific language, refining your search for better results.

Example: If I am interested in learning about the farmers' protest in the EU, but only want to get results in Dutch, the  parameters may look like this:

TIP:&#x20;

_Language and Search Terms_

Twitter Advanced Search prioritizes your exact keywords during the search. This means:

* If you search for an English term but want results in Dutch, tweets containing the English word and Dutch text might appear.

_Finding Local Content with Translation_

To focus on local content in a specific language:

1. Translate your keywords using Google Translate or DeepL.
2. Use the translated keywords in your Twitter Advanced Search.
{% endhint %}

**ACCOUNTS**

Find posts from specific accounts to specific accounts or mention specific accounts. This enables users to see the interaction or exchange between accounts. This is particularly useful for tracking disinformation/misinformation to see who has interacted with which content and whether or not those accounts agree or disagree with each other.&#x20;

These are the subfilters:&#x20;

**“From these accounts”** Searching for posts from \`@Iamsterdam\` will show posts posted by this account.

**“To these accounts.”** Searching for posts sent to @Iamsterdam will show posts in which other users mentioned or replied to @Iamsterdam.

**“Mentioning these accounts”** Searching for posts mentioning @Iamsterdam will show posts from other users that include the @Iamsterdam handle.

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: You can input more than one account
{% endhint %}

\
**“Filters”:** Refine your Twitter search! Advanced Search lets you choose whether to include replies, ensuring you see the full conversation or focus solely on original posts.

To see only original posts, deselect the "Replies" checkbox under "Account Filters" in Twitter Advanced Search.

\[placeholder screenshot]

**“Replies”:** One targeted feature is the ability to focus solely on replies. By excluding original posts, you can gain a deeper understanding of the ongoing discussion surrounding a particular topic.

This ability to isolate replies proves especially valuable in numerous areas. For instance:

* Sentiment Analysis: By analyzing replies, you can gauge the public's emotional response to a brand, product, or event.
* Tracking Opinions: Focusing on replies allows you to see what people are saying about a specific topic, revealing trends.&#x20;

**“Links”:** Twitter Advanced Search lets you refine your results even further. You can choose to see only posts containing links. This can be useful for finding content that references external sources.

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: This filter does not allow you to specify a specific website or URL. The search will simply include posts with any link, regardless of the domain.
{% endhint %}

**ENGAGEMENTS**

{% hint style="warning" %}
NOTE: If you want to cut through the noise and discover the most popular posts on a topic. Twitter's "Top posts" tab might seem like the answer, but it doesn't always show the absolute most engaging content. [The "Top posts" algorithm considers various factors, making it unpredictable.](https://blog.x.com/engineering/en\_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm) Use Advanced Search instead.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In Twitter Advanced Search, you can define your own criteria for engagement. Want to see posts with at least 1,000 likes or replies? Advanced Search lets you set precise thresholds for minimum likes, reposts, replies, or even a combination of these metrics. This way, you'll get a clear picture of the most engaging posts that meet your specific requirements.

You can set your own parameters for the following subfields:

**“Minimum replies”**

**“Minimum Likes”**

**“Minimum reposts”**&#x20;

This granular control ensures the retrieval of posts that demonstrably resonate with a significant portion of the user base.

**DATES**

For highly focused searches, Twitter Advanced Search offers date range filtering..

To filter tweets by date, use the calendar dropdown menus in Twitter Advanced Search. Simply select:

**"From" date:** This will return tweets sent on or after that date.

**"To" date:** This will return tweets sent on or before that date.

**Both "From" and "To" dates:** This will return tweets sent _**within**_ that specific date range.

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP:&#x20;

**Before a specific date:** Perfect for exploring historical trends or past events.&#x20;

**After a specific date:** Ideal for catching up on recent discussions or tracking breaking news.&#x20;

**Within a defined date range:** Ideal for isolating tweets from a specific timeframe, like a conference or campaign
{% endhint %}

If a user changes their handle, the [Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) tool won't return tweets under the new handle that were posted under the old handle, but searching for tweets under the old handle still works.

### _**Advanced Search Through Mobile App**_

If doing Advanced Search on a mobile device, users can go to the mobile device’s web browser and perform the steps above with the Advanced Search interface.&#x20;

However, if you must do a granular search on the X app, you can do so in the search box, using operators or boolean, just as one would when searching various search engines like Google.&#x20;

X’s website provides [a list](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/rules-and-filtering/search-operators) of helpful operators that users can use or memorize to be able to perform the functions outlined above. However, [use this page](https://github.com/igorbrigadir/twitter-advanced-search) for a more exhaustive list of operators for the App search bar.&#x20;

A sample search done on mobile can be seen in the image below.&#x20;

### _**What problem does it solve?**_&#x20;

In April 2024, Statista estimated a staggering [611 million people ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/)actively using X per month. This translates to a sea of user-generated content constantly flowing around real-time events and trending topics. For open-source investigators, navigating this vast ocean of information to find what they need will be a daunting task. Twitter Advanced Search addresses this challenge by providing comprehensive filtering options and its ability to search across a wide range of criteria.

As open-source investigators, the research process is often iterative. We often start broad, using search terms like "protest" and "Syria" in the discovery phase. As we sift through the initial results, we might encounter posts mentioning a specific location like "Daraa" or a prominent activist group named "Syrian Revolutionary Forces." These findings become stepping stones. We then refine our search terms, incorporating these new details or harvesting new search terms. This might involve searching for posts containing "Daraa protest" or "Syrian Revolutionary Forces leader." The search might also expand to Arabic hashtags related to the protest or the activist group.

Manipulating Twitter's Advanced Search features using various combinations of parameters like locations, languages, and hashtags becomes crucial in this dynamic process. It allows investigators to refine their search queries continuously, as they delve deeper into the investigation.

### _**Use case**_&#x20;

1. Using Twitter Advanced Search, especially its hashtag search, is helpful for monitoring events and violence surrounding a protest or movement. [According to the Atlantic Council's DFRLab](https://medium.com/dfrlab/how-pro-democracy-activists-in-myanmar-keep-their-movement-alive-with-hashtags-34ff2d3eddf2), hashtags are a crucial tool for protest movements. By strategically coordinating hashtags, protesters can amplify their message and draw attention to potential injustices. In this study,&#x20;

## Level of difficulty

## Requirements

1. Internet connection
2. Desktop/Laptop/Mobile Device (for mobile, use the web browser instead of the App)
3. Creating a user account&#x20;

## Limitations

The following limitations were found by testing the tool.&#x20;

1. **Handle Changes and Search Scope:**

If a user changes their handle, the[ Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) tool won't return posts under the new handle that were posted under the old handle, but searching for posts under the old handle still works.

2. **Missing Misspellings and Variations:**

Even after using the advanced search tool, you might miss tweets with typos or variations in the spelling of your search term. This is because the tool searches for exact matches.

The fix is to cast a wider net. Here's the good news: you can improve your search results by considering misspelled variations. Simply take those misspellings and alternative spellings you discover and use them as new search terms related to the same topic. Add these variations to your existing list of keyword combinations.

By including these additional spellings, you'll be conducting a more comprehensive search and ensure you capture more relevant tweets, even if they contain typos.

3. **Keyword Specificity and Irrelevant Results:**

After testing the tool, if the keyword is common or used in different contexts, it might retrieve irrelevant mentions. Let's say you're searching for information about the recent developments in "electric cars." This is a common term, used in many different contexts.

The search might return tweets about a toy car commercial featuring electric vehicles, a news report on a power outage affecting electric car charging stations, etc., and might not be relevant to your specific interest in the latest advancements in electric car technology.

4. **Account Requirement for Advanced Search:**

After testing the Advanced Search tool in both Incognito Mode and regular browsing, in both cases, using the tool required signing into an account. This means you cannot access Advanced Search features on X.com without logging in. For some, requiring an account restricts access to these crucial functionalities for investigators who prefer anonymity.&#x20;

5. **Inconsistent "None of These Words" Function:**

It also does not catch all the search parameters. Testing both in the web browser and the mobile App, “None of these words” sometimes does not perform as well. It does not remove all the keywords you wish to eliminate. If you put more than 1 or 2 in the “none of these words” field, it will not catch all these parameters, and will sometimes still show results that contain those words you want excluded.&#x20;

6. **The “Links” Filter Cannot Specify a Domain**

As mentioned above, users can search for posts containing links however one cannot specify which domain. However users can circumvent this limitation by using search operators directly on the search bar. [For example: ](https://medium.com/@prajwalshivareddy/unlocking-the-power-of-x-formerly-twitter-unveiling-effective-search-methods-and-syntax-69974a27d12)url:example.com&#x20;

7. **Limits to Available History of Posts**

Twitter's Advanced Search boasts an impressive range, allowing you to delve into tweets [dating back to the platform's launch and first public post in 2006](https://help.x.com/en/using-x/x-advanced-search). However, keep in mind that private accounts and deleted tweets may be absent from your search results.&#x20;

8. **Inability to Filter For Media**

Open-source investigators are constantly looking for and collecting media during research, whether images or videos. The Advanced Search does not have a search filter for this. To do so, investigators may prefer to  use boolean or search operators on the search bar to find what they need. An example would be to input “Amsterdam” as a keyword and add [filter:native\_video (or filter:media or filter:videos, etc)](https://github.com/igorbrigadir/twitter-advanced-search)

One can also use the search bar using keywords, and click on the Media tab under the results
