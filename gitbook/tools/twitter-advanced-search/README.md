**Advanced Search Through Web Browser**

Twitter/X’s Advanced Search makes it ideal for source investigations. It helps refine search queries and produces more subject matter-specific results. While the search interface is mostly self-explanatory, below is a description of each search field.&#x20;

**“All of these words”:**&#x20;

You can search for posts containing specific words, phrases, or hashtags.

Example: Amsterdam canals

This will show posts that mention  “Amsterdam” and “canals”

**“This exact phrase”** is similar to using quotation marks on search engines. It pulls up results for an exact match for a specific sequence of words.&#x20;

Example: best of both worlds&#x20;

This will generate results with this exact phrase.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is okay not to use quotation marks for this search parameter. If you do, they will generate the same results as without quotation marks.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Any of these words”:** A user can use this field to filter terms that contain one search term or another.&#x20;

Example: Amsterdam canals&#x20;

This will search for posts with either just “Amsterdam” or just “canals”&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can add OR between the search terms, and it will generate the same results&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Hashtags”:** Advanced Search allows you to filter your search further using hashtags. This is particularly useful for monitoring events in real-time.&#x20;

Example: If I want to search for content related to Myanmar but only want to focus on the June 3rd coup, I will enter “Myanmar” on the top field and “June3Coup” or “WhatsHappingInMyanmar” on the hashtag field. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Users do not have to use the hash (#) symbol in the field, but the tool generates the same search if they choose to. (i.e. June3Coup or #June3Coup will generate the same results) &#x20;
{% endhint %}

**“Language”:** Twitter Advanced Search allows you to zero in on posts in a specific language, refining your search for better results.

Example: If I am interested in learning about the farmers' protest in the EU, but only want to get results in Dutch, the  parameters may look like this:

TIP: Language and Search Terms

Twitter Advanced Search prioritizes your exact keywords during the search. This means:

* If you search for an English term but want results in Dutch, tweets containing the English word and Dutch text might appear.

Finding Local Content with Translation:

To focus on local content in a specific language:

1. Translate your keywords using Google Translate or DeepL.
2. Use the translated keywords in your Twitter Advanced Search.
{% endhint %}

**ACCOUNTS**

Find posts from specific accounts to specific accounts, or mention specific accounts. This enables users to see the interaction or exchange between accounts. This is particularly useful for tracking disinformation/misinformation to see who has interacted with which content and the account's reputation. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: You can input more than one account
{% endhint %}

## Limitations

If a user changes their handle, the [Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) tool won't return tweets under the new handle that were posted under the old handle, but searching for tweets under the old handle still works.
