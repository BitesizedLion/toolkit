## Description

DeHashed has compiled a searchable database of leaked personal information and  sensitive data. It allows users to search through billions of records, including names, email addresses, usernames, IP address, physical address, phone number, vehicle identification number, and domains.&#x20;

## Step-by-step guide on how to use DeHashed

If you search by, say, email address, you will get a list of various data points associated with that email, including names and passwords.
