# ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database

## URL

[http://offshoreleaks.icij.org/](http://offshoreleaks.icij.org/)

## Description

The database is a repository of five major leaks that were used to conduct hard-hitting investigations. &#x20;

There are various ways to explore the database:

### Conducting searches in the whole dataset

1. Users can do searches in the whole database. Write the entity name, its jurisdiction or location in the search bar. For instance, “Mossack Fonseca.”

2. Results can be abundant. On the left, you can filter the results by “offshore entities,” “officers,” “intermediaries,” and “addresses.”&#x20;

3. After filtering, select the required result. An interactive map shows connections between categories like "officer" and "address". Click on the nodes to receive more information.&#x20;

ICIJ also provides a detailed section on “[How to use the Offshore Leaks Database.](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/howtouse)”

### Search each database separately

ICIJ Offshore Leaks also allows users to explore each of the five datasets separately. After selecting a dataset of your choice, you can explore the results for a specific person or company based on this selection. Links to stories/investigations are also provided under each dataset window. Here is an example for the [Pandora Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/).

### “The Power Players”

[The Power Players](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/power-players) section enables users to search for notable names linked to "offshore connections of world leaders, politicians, and their relatives and associates" from three major leaks: Pandora Papers, Paradise Papers, and Panama Papers. Users can explore key figures of public interest from all three leaks combined or from each leak individually.

### Downloading the dataset

All five leak databases can be downloaded as [zip files](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database). The zip files include:

1. Offshore Leaks (2013)
2. Panama Papers (2016)
3. Bahamas Leaks (2016)
4. Paradise Papers (2017)
5. Pandora Papers (2021)

For user convenience, the data is converted to multiple CSV files, providing the freedom to explore the dataset on the user's terms. The data is also available as "Neo4j" exported databases. ICIJ provides a [GitHub repository guide](https://github.com/ICIJ/offshoreleaks-data-packages) that explains how to import the data into the Neo4j.

### &#x20;Reconciliation API

The reconciliation API requires some API expertise and allows users to match their own datasets against the ICIJ database. The ICIJ webpage provides a detailed guide on how to use this [feature.](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/docs/reconciliation)&#x20;

## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

The dataset is free to explore.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The visualization of downloaded datasets requires familiarity with Neo4j software. The same applies to the use of the Reconciliation API.

When using the dataset, you have to credit the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

## Limitations

Not all names behind entities can appear in the dataset. "information about ownership is often buried in emails, power-of-attorney letters and internal notes and cannot easily be extracted in a systematic manner," says ICIJ.

The data does not include personal information such as bank accounts, email exchanges, or financial transactions. Researchers seeking this type of information may need to use other OSINT tools or data. sources.

## Ethical Considerations

Entities in the database are not necessarily involved in any wrongdoing. ICIJ states in its FAQ section: "There are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts. We do not intend to suggest or imply that any individuals, companies or other entities included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database have broken the law or otherwise acted improperly." Understanding which entities are involved and the purpose of the research is crucial.

## Guide

ICIJ offshore leaks provides a three part series on how to use the [database](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/howtouse).

However, it may be a bit dated since more leaks were added to the database after 2018.
