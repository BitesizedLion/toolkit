# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
  "tags": [
    "google",
    "other-networks"
  ],
  "name": "Google Account Finder (EPIEOS)",
  "url": "https://tools.epieos.com/google-account.php",
  "description": "Find the profile picture and public Google Map Reviews + Photos associated with a G-mail adress. Also checks for phone numbers, and checks for email addresses on social networks",
  "cost": "Free"
}
```
{% endcode %}

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in light blue font) and do not change the key names (left side, slightly darker blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition". Seperate tags with a comma `,`.

If a tool is completely free to use, include the tag "free".
