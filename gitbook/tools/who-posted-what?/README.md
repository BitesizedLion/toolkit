## Description

Who Posted What enables users to conduct keyword searches between a designated time period on Facebook. This is useful since Facebook doesn't support searches within a specific time frame.

Various searches can be conducted via options provided by Who Posted What. Some categories use a user ID (UID) for the searches to be conducted. A Facebook UID is a unique numeric identifier assigned to each user profile.

Some URLs of the profile must be put in the “Get ID” bar to get a UID. However, many profiles have UID at the end of URL (highlighted in bold): https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=**100094902271869**, which corresponds to the Facebook account of the "Sindh Information Commission." Same applies to location UIDs.

A search can be:

1. A keyword on a specific day: “Ukraine” on February 4, 2020. A new tab will open on Facebook showing posts related to Ukraine on Feb. 4 of 2020.
2. A keyword search for a specific month: “Barack Obama” from “September 2020.” The new tab opens with relevant results.
3. A keyword search for a specific year: “coronavirus” from “2019.” This search helps test the reliability of the tool. For 2019 there are no results for coronavirus. But when we change the year to 2020, the results are abundant, since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020.
4. Timerange: This option allows users to search keywords between specific time periods. Posts about “Emmanuel Macron” from August 22, 2019 to February 20, 2021. A new tab with relevant results open.
5. Location: Enter “Mark Kelly” from User ID “105540216147364” which corresponds to Phoenix, Arizona. Explore posts about Kelly in the new Facebook tab.
6. “Posts directly from/Posts associated with”: This search query allows you to find posts about keywords from user accounts of your interest. Copy paste "https://www.facebook.com/narendramodi” into the bar under “Get ID.” For the Indian prime minister, his UID is “100044527235621.” Select “post from” or“posts associated with” from the drop down options. Enter “100044527235621” into "Posts from"_,_ then “Mosque” into "about." A new tab on Facebook opens, showing Modi’s posts about mosques.
