## Description

The Aqueduct water Risk Atlas, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), is an interactive platform for assessing water-related risks globally. It provides a detailed, visual analysis of water stress, scarcity, and other water risk indicators using geographic information system (GIS). Researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists widely use it to identify and address water resource challenges.

### What does this tool do?

The tool provides access to a lot of data regarding global water risks, such as water scarcity, flood risks, and drought severity. \
You can **explore the water risks** on a map on different levels, like country, basin, or sub-basin levels. \
Itâ€™s also possible to **watch various scenarios**, such as optimistic, pessimistic, and business-as-usual models. You can customize visualisations  based on specific timeframes, for example annual or monthly. Zoom in on the area you are interested in and select the Future option. After this you can select your timeframe, scenario and an indicator.



### What can researchers use it for?

The Aqueduct water risk atlas can be a useful resource  for (open source) researchers who are investigating the following topics:

* Environmental investigations\
  For example: Analyse regions facing acute water stress or shortages.
* Conflict and security\
  For example: overlay population density data with water scarcity layers.
* Policy development\
  For example: Provide recommendations for sustainable water management.

## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

Registration is not required to use the tool.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

The map has a user-friendly interface and is easy to use, but users with a familiarity with water risk indicators may benefit more.

## Requirements

The only requirements are internet access and a browser like Chrome or Firefox. Some knowledge with GIS or water risk indicators might come in handy, but it's not a dealbreaker.

## Limitations

There are a few limitations to keep in mind when using the tool:\
Some regions, like remote regions or certain developing countries, might lack data due to limited water monitoring infrastructure.\
The tool includes historical and future projections, but there might not be enough data for real-time analysis.\
The projections for optimistic, pessimistic and business-as-usual, are based on assumptions.

## Ethical Considerations

Like every tool, ensure that the use of the tool is within the law, the site's terms of services, and ethical OSINT guidelines.
