## Description

ImportGenius is a paid-for online database of shipping data for countries including the US, Russia and India (see the [full list](https://www.importgenius.com/how-it-works)). The data is sourced from country governments. It consists of bills of lading, which are legal documents detailing the type, quantity and destination of the goods being transported:

ImportGenius does not have a free search. An OSINT investigator might find it worth paying for access for a limited time as this data is not generally available for free. (It is for the US through [ImportYeti](https://app.gitbook.com/o/WQpOq5ZFue4N6m65QCJq/s/GJyHaCYBR6gnNIW1tHhY/).)

It costs US$199 per month and almost all their countries can be subscribed to on a monthly basis. Their Russia data is only available on an annual subscription and is updated every six months (it used to be updated more frequently, until the war with the Ukraine started in 2022).

Free training is available for subscribers, even if you sign up for one month.

Note that the data provided per country differs, and it is updated at different frequencies per country - so it's worth having a demo before you subscribe. Ask about whether they cover shipping or other modes of transport for the countries in which you are interested.

Panjiva and PIERS are similar paid-for services, with some different country coverage. They do not advertise their costs.
