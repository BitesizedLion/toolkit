## Description

This tool helps users estimate the maximum number of people standing by a particular area. MapChecking is a crowd-counting tool designed to assist in visualizing and analyzing the area covered by a specific event or situation, typically protests, demonstrations, or other gatherings. The tool allows users to input parameters such as the area they are expected to occupy, the shape of the area (by drawing a polygon.), and the estimated density of the crowd.

Based on the inputs below, MapChecking calculates the estimated density of participants and the overall space they would cover on a map.

1. Input Location
2. Draw Polygon To Delineate Area of Interest
3. Map Visualization and Matching
4. Calculate Crowd Density

### Why is crowd counting significant?&#x20;

The number of crowds can often be a [point of dispute ](https://apnews.com/general-news-f445adb3d0cf468ba0eb9caeab549577)between [participants and official statements](https://www.salon.com/2003/01/24/crowds/). Crowd sizes can also serve as evidence of how many people participated in a demonstration and [can be indicative of the significance](https://nixintel.info/osint/counting-crowds-in-public-spaces/) or reach of the event. According to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10116033/), another significance of crowd counting is that “\[e]stimation of crowd size for large gatherings is an indispensable metric for \[...] local authorities, and emergency management.”&#x20;

Traditional crowd counting methods are either less publically available, [such as entrance censors/turnstiles and ticket sales, or are a tedious and time-consuming procedure that includes cumbersome manual processes such as using people counters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10116033/).

For this reason, open-source investigators may find this a valuable tool for verification.&#x20;

### Here's how the tool generally works

For this example, we take the recent protest in Tel Aviv on 1 September 2024. This[ post ](https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1830315386056970556)mentions that the protest had about 300,000+ participants.&#x20;
