# DomainTools Whois Lookup

## URL

[https://whois.domaintools.com/](https://whois.domaintools.com/)

## Description

DomainTools Whois allows you to gather information about a domain name including domain name registration information, including the registrant's contact details, registration dates. These details can help to identify ownership and administrative details of a domain.

The data fields returned in the primary Whois entry can be used to pivot to additional data points during an investigation. For example, you can see the number of other domains associated with the registrant, the number of other domains hosted on the same IP address, and the number of historical Whois records in the DomainTools database.

The main Whois page includes a mix of free and paid tools that are offered by DomainsTools. You can use these by hovering over the small arrows next to some of the entries (e.g. Name Servers, IP Address etc.) or from the Tools section on the right side of the page.

## Limitations & Ethical Considerations

Certain pivots and additional tools require a paid subscription to DomainTools.&#x20;

As part of domain privacy measures, most domain registrars offer Whois privacy services that anonymize the registrant details. As a result, you may not be able to find the real name of the individual who owns a domain or other details associated with them. Instead you will see a "Registration Private" designation where the individual's name would be, and generic email and physical addresses associated with the domain registrar. For example, Bellingcat.com's Whois record contains such privacy measures:

In certain instances, you may be able to surface names or addresses a ssociated with real invidiuals by going back in Whois&#x20;
