## Description

This tool helps you explore and visualize wildlife trade seizures around the world by filtering by individual incidents or events. You can search by species, countries involved and dates. An advanced search allows you to include incidents involving organized crime and corruption, people, specific locations and taxonomic characteristics of species. As a result you will get charts that enable you to explore incidents by year and by taxonomy, plus a results page with a list of the incident, a map page that locates incidents in the countries involved, and other charts that you can reproduce and modify depending on what you need, for example, you can see the number of people by government involvement over time or the number of incidents by type of transit over time. You can also search for multiple species. In this way, you can find incidents related to each species and incidents related to all the species you are looking for. results can be exported.

You can contribute to this site by providing the source, the date, the country of the incident, any associated countries on the trade route, any associated species, the type of commodity, and the quantity of commodity of a seizure of which you are aware.

There are two other tools within this one. The first is an interactive and visual web platform that provides timber trade data, called TimberStats. The second is a web tool for visualizing trade data sets as trade flow arrows on a map, called TradeMapper. These sites are independent, but you must register on the Wildlife Trade Portal to use and explore them.
