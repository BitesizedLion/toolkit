## Limitations

The ACLED dataset and tools come with several limitations that researchers should be aware of before deciding to utilize them in their projects:

* **Geographical Coverage**: While ACLED covers over 50 countries around the world, there may be gaps in coverage, especially in regions with less accessible information or ongoing conflicts.
* **Data Updates**: Though ACLED regularly updates its dataset, there can be a lag in reporting of certain events due to the time it takes to verify information. This might affect research that requires the most current data.
* **Resolution and Granularity**: The level of detail and granularity of data can vary by location and event, potentially impacting analyses that require uniform detail across datasets.
* **Access Restrictions**: Some detailed data or analysis tools may only be available to users with specific access levels, which could limit the scope of research for those with basic access.
* **Dependence on Open Sources**: The quality and reliability of ACLED data is dependent on the availability and veracity of open sources. In regions where media is restricted or unreliable, this could impact the accuracy of the dataset.
* _**Conflict Alert System (CAST):**_ as a future forecasting system it comes with caveats around accuracy. To understand more see the methodology [here](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm\_uploads/2023/07/ACLED-CAST-Methodology-%E2%80%93-July-2023.pdf).

Researchers should consider these limitations in conjunction with their research goals and methodologies to determine if ACLED's tools and datasets are suitable for their needs.

## Ethical Considerations

When using ACLED's tools and datasets, researchers must navigate several ethical considerations to ensure responsible utilization and dissemination of sensitive information:

* **Respect for Privacy**: Care should be taken to avoid disclosing identifiable information about individuals involved in conflict incidents, respecting their privacy and safety.
* **Data Misinterpretation**: There is a risk that data could be misinterpreted or taken out of context, potentially leading to harmful conclusions or actions. Researchers must strive for accuracy and clarity in their analyses.
* **Potential for Harm**: The information contained within the ACLED datasets can be sensitive. Researchers should consider the potential harm that could arise from the publication of their findings, especially in volatile regions.
* **Bias and Representation**: It's important to acknowledge any biases that might exist in the data collection and reporting processes and understand how these may affect the representation of certain groups or incidents.
* **Ethical Use and Attribution**: Users of ACLED data should commit to using the data ethically, including proper attribution and acknowledgment of ACLED as the data source, and should not use the data for purposes that could incite violence or conflict.

Researchers and users of ACLED data are encouraged to engage with these ethical considerations thoughtfully, ensuring their work contributes positively to the understanding and resolution of conflicts globally.
