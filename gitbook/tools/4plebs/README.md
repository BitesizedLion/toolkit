4plebs.org is an archive site that primarily focuses on archiving threads from various boards on the 4chan imageboard. This includes popular sections such as /pol/ (Politically Incorrect), /x/ (Paranormal), /tg/ (Traditional Games), and several others. The site provides a searchable database of past threads, allowing users to find and revisit discussions and content that have been posted on 4chan, which typically removes threads after a certain period. The archive is used by researchers, enthusiasts, and casual users who are interested in exploring or referencing the content that has been posted on 4chan in the past. As an example, a researcher studying internet culture may use 4plebs.org to compile data on specific trends or topics discussed within 4chan's communities over time.

## Ethical Considerations

When using 4plebs for research purposes, it's imperative to consider the following ethical aspects:

* **Privacy and Consent**: Although 4plebs archives public posts, researchers should be mindful of the privacy expectations of individuals who made those posts. Not all users understand or anticipate their contributions being analyzed or quoted in research.
* **Data Anonymization**: Take steps to anonymize identifiable information within datasets derived from 4plebs. This includes usernames, locations, or any other personally identifiable information, unless obtaining direct consent from the individuals is feasible.
* **Bias and Representativeness**: Acknowledge that the data collected from 4plebs may not be representative of broader populations or viewpoints. Research findings should be contextualized within the scope and limitations of the data source.
* **Ethical Use of Content**: Be cautious and respectful when using content that may be sensitive, offensive, or controversial. Researchers should critically evaluate the necessity and implications of including such content in their work.
* **Compliance with Institutional Guidelines**: Ensure that your research adheres to the ethics guidelines and approval requirements set by your institution or research body.
* **The Oxygen of Amplification**_**:**_ Think carefully about what you publish not to unwittingly amplify some of the messaging present on 4Chan (see: Phillips, W. (2018) _The Oxygen of Amplification_, _Data & Society_. Data & Society Research Institute. Available at: [https://datasociety.net/library/oxygen-of-amplification/](https://datasociety.net/library/oxygen-of-amplification/) (Accessed: 22 April 2024)).

Considering these ethical guidelines will help maintain the integrity of your research and protect the rights and dignity of individuals whose posts might be included in your study.
