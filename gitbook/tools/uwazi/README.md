## Description

**Uwazi** is an open-source platform that simplifies document collection management, organization, and analysis, particularly for human rights documentation and justice-focused projects. It addresses the challenge of storing, categorizing, and retrieving large volumes of sensitive information, making it easy to manage complex datasets.

With Uwazi, researchers can upload documents in bulk, organize them with precise metadata, cross-reference related materials, and search the entire collection efficiently. The platform also allows the translation of records into multiple languages, visualizes data in various formats, and allows collaboration with team members while maintaining strict security controls.

Uwazi is ideal for organizations and individuals who need a user-friendly, secure, and customizable tool to manage critical information, whether for preserving evidence, documenting violations, or creating accessible archives. It offers powerful features tailored to the needs of human rights defenders, researchers, and advocacy groups, making it an indispensable resource for those working to uncover and pursue justice.

Uwazi offers two deployment options: **self-hosted (free)** and **hosted**. With the **self-hosted** option, users can download and set up Uwazi on their own servers at no cost. This option provides full control over the platform, including customization and data security, but it requires technical expertise to install, manage, and maintain the server environment. Self-hosting also implies responsibility for implementing security measures, performing updates, and ensuring system reliability, which might be challenging for organizations without a dedicated IT team.

On the other hand, the **hosted** option involves using Uwazi’s managed hosting service, where the platform is hosted and maintained by [HURIDOCS](https://huridocs.org/). This option is ideal for organizations that prefer a hassle-free setup with support and regular updates handled by the Uwazi team. While hosted services typically involve a cost beyond the initial free 30-day trial, they offer the convenience of professional management, enhanced security, and reliable uptime, making it a suitable choice for organizations with limited technical resources.

#### Key Features:

1. **Flexible Data Management**: Uwazi supports the upload and management of various types of documents, including text files, images, audio, and video. The platform allows users to create custom collections with defined metadata fields, facilitating structured and efficient data organization.
2. **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Uwazi offers sophisticated search functionalities, enabling users to perform full-text searches, apply multiple filters, and quickly retrieve relevant documents from extensive collections.
3. **Data Visualization and Mapping**: Users can create visual representations of data and link documents to maps, particularly useful for geographically-oriented human rights documentation.
4. **Customizable Workflows**: Uwazi allows users to define custom workflows, automating tasks and processes to streamline document management and review.
5. **Multi-language Support**: The platform supports multilingual document collections and provides a fully localized user interface, making it accessible for global projects.
6. **Collaboration and Permissions**: Uwazi facilitates collaboration with its multi-user environment, where permissions can be finely tuned to protect sensitive information.
7. **Public and Private Sharing**: The platform enables the secure sharing of document collections, with options for both public access and private, controlled sharing.
8. **Security and Compliance**: Uwazi incorporates strong security measures, including encrypted data storage and secure access controls, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and safeguarding sensitive information.
9. Integration with the Tella App: Once set up, Uwazi databases can be populated via the [Tella App](https://tella-app.org/), which provides encrypted asynchronous uploads of photos and videos from a user's phone, in an environment separate from the phone's gallery.

## Requirements

To use Uwazi, particularly if you're opting for the self-hosted version, you'll need a server with sufficient resources to handle the platform and a level of technical expertise to manage installation and maintenance. For both hosted and self-hosted options, you need a valid email address to set up accounts and manage user permissions. No additional software is required if using the hosted version, as HURIDOCS handles all management.

## Limitations

*   **Technical Setup**: Setting up and customizing Uwazi can require significant technical expertise, especially for self-hosted deployments. While managed hosting is available, it may come with additional costs.

    **Integration Capabilities**: Uwazi's ability to integrate with other tools and platforms is somewhat limited, which could challenge organizations using a diverse software ecosystem.

    **Configuration Requirements**: Uwazi's flexibility demands careful initial configuration, including defining categories, relationships, templates, and filters. This process can be complex, particularly for projects with extensive data needs.&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

When using Uwazi, especially for human rights documentation, handling sensitive information responsibly is crucial. This includes safeguarding personal data, respecting privacy laws, and ensuring data security, particularly when documenting human rights abuses or storing victims' information. Users must also consider the potential impact of publicly sharing certain datasets. Proper ethical practices protect vulnerable individuals and communities while ensuring that Uwazi is used in a manner consistent with legal and moral standards.

#### **Security Measures:**

* **Data Encryption**: Uwazi uses HTTPS encryption for secure data transmission, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. Uwazi also supports data encryption at rest, ensuring that all sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access during transmission and while stored on the server.&#x20;
* **User Authentication**: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is available to enhance account security.
* **Hosting Security**: Uwazi’s hosted environments are secured with regular updates and security patches.
* **Data Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups must be conducted to ensure data integrity and availability in case of failures.
