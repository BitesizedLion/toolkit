## Description

TGStat is a Russia-based social media analytics platform that offers comprehensive statistics and insights for public Telegram channels and open groups. With its extensive database, it provides detailed information on popular Telegram channels and members, including engagement metrics, growth trends, and audience demographics. TGStat covers statistics for over 14,000 Telegram channels, encompassing:

\-        Subscriber numbers

\-        Average post reach

\-        Daily views

\-        Share count

\-        Mentions

\-        Posting frequency

TGStat is useful for discovery, especially for those monitoring events in Russian-speaking countries, post-Soviet regions or far-right groups. It analyzes a diverse set of channels and public groups. The statistics are current and updated daily.

_**What problem does it solve?**_

TGStat solves a discovery and time management issue. Telegram’s search function lacks advanced features and filters, making it difficult for unfamiliar users to find specific information. Success often relies on knowing local terminology and search nuances. However, TGStat can assist through discovery, comparison, and analytics.

**Discovery:** It assists researchers in finding relevant channels to follow on specific topics. Some features are:

1. _Filter by country:_ On TGStat, users can filter channels by country. The list of countries available in the search filters are: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, China, India, and Ethiopia.\

However, posts in public channels and open groups from other countries and languages are also often covered by TGStat analytics.\

2. _Filter by theme/region:_ When researching Telegram channels in Russia, channels are grouped by region and by theme/topics. For the other countries, channels can be filtered by theme but not by regions.

3. _Filter by rating:_ TGStat also has a rating system for both channel and posts. This in turn is a useful indicator of channel popularity and audience engagement.

**Comparison:** TGStat also solves the problem of visualizing posts reach and its relationship with other actors, channels and content. TGstat can pull up a specific channel's analytics and show the relationship between channels through the “citation” section. This section shows who cites whom. Some thematic similarities in content between channels overlap.

&#x20;

Another way to see the relationship between channels is through the "similar channels" and “related channels” section of the profile in question.&#x20;

\
In addition, users can see the popularity of a channel or group overtime.

&#x20;_**Analytics:**_ TGStat assists in analyzing content and reach.  It provides insight on the channel or group’s performance, such as subscriber numbers, subscribers acquired overtime or those acquired based on popularity of posts, reach, views per posts, and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) per individual posts. This enables the user to understand what type of content resonates with a particular audience.

### Ethical Consideration

If you're considering using TGStat, it's wise to weigh these potential limitations against your needs. It might be a good option for getting a basic overview of your Telegram channel or group, but for more in-depth analysis, you might need to explore other options.

* **Be mindful of data accuracy/specify data provenance:** TGStat relies on data provided by Telegram, so the accuracy of the information it presents depends on Telegram's data. Be mindful of discrepancies and seek to validate data if possible. It is advisable to specify data provenance by citing TGstat.
* **Be mindful of over-quantification and limited scope of data:** Balance any research with other approaches so that it is not dominated only by data, numerical information, measurement, etc. Analytics tools might offer some in-depth analytics but users must be aware and specify where the limits are of the data.
* **Privacy Concerns:** You're providing your Telegram data to a third-party service, so there are inherent privacy risks. Make sure you trust the tool and understand their data practices.
* **Be mindful of OPSEC concerns when logging in:** It is advisable for users to be aware of any security vulnerabilities associated with accessing the metrics through loggin in.&#x20;
