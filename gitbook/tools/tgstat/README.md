## Description

TGStat is a Russia-based social media analytics platform that offers comprehensive statistics and insights for public Telegram channels and open groups. With its database, it provides detailed information on popular Telegram channels and members, including engagement metrics, growth trends, and audience demographics. TGStat covers statistics for over [14,000](https://popsters.com/blog/post/statistics-and-analytics-on-telegram) Telegram [channels](https://chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://cis.temple.edu/\~jiewu/research/publications/Publication\_files/Telegram\_ICWS.pdf), encompassing:

\- Subscriber numbers

\- Average post reach

\- Daily views

\- Share count

\- Mentions

\- Posting frequency

TGStat is useful for discovery, especially for those monitoring events in Russian-speaking countries, post-Soviet regions, or far-right groups. It analyzes a diverse set of channels and public groups. The statistics are constantly being refreshed and updated in [real-time](https://databar.ai/explore/tgstat).

_**What problem does it solve?**_

TGStat solves a discovery and time management issue. Telegram’s search function lacks advanced features and filters, making it difficult for unfamiliar users to find specific information. Success often relies on knowing local terminology and search nuances. However, TGStat can assist through discovery, comparison, and analytics.

**Discovery:** It assists researchers in finding relevant channels to follow on specific topics. Some features are:

1. _Filter by country:_ On TGStat, users can filter channels by country. The list of countries available in the search filters are: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, China, India, and Ethiopia.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0178.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>This shows a catalog of public Telegram channels and open groups categorzed by country. The user can navigate to this feature by clicking “Catalog” in the upper left, then clicking “channels and groups catalog”. </p></figcaption></figure>

However, users can find any public channel or open groups not covered by the countries listed in the catalog.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-06-24 170220.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is a public news channel with a Telegram account. The screenshot shows the TGStat analytics for the channel. In the upper right corner, the "channel's geo and language" is displayed. The channel is primarily in Arabic, and the specific country is not mentioned. This means that users may not be able to find this channel by browsing the catalog grouped by country. Instead, they can search for the channel's username using the site's search bar. This demonstrates that TGStat provides information for public channels on Telegram, irrespective of their country and language.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. _Filter by theme/region:_ When researching Telegram channels in Russia, channels are grouped by region and by theme/topics. For the other countries, channels can be filtered by theme but not by regions.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0184.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>For Russia-based channels, users can filter by region as shown in the image. You can navigate through this by clicking "Catalog" in the upper left corner, and then by clicking on "regional compilations."</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0185.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>For Russia-based channels, users can filter by themes/subject as shown in the image. You can navigate through this by clicking "Catalog" in the upper left corner, and then by clicking on "thematic compilations."</p></figcaption></figure>

3. _Filter by rating:_ TGStat also has a rating system for channels, groups and posts. This in turn is a useful indicator of channel popularity and audience engagement.

_Channels rating:_ The top 100 Telegram channels (both public and private) are rated by the most number of subscribers, by growth, by reach, and by citation. Users can filter the growth metrics by daily growth, growth the previous day, weekly growth, and monthly growth. It also rates public channels by reach and citations. (how many times, a particular channel is mentioned by other channels). Users can filter channels by country or view global rankings. TGStat also rates the top 100 channels according to topic and similarly rates them according to the most number of subscribers, growth, reach and citation.

_Groups rating:_

**Comparison:** TGStat also solves the problem of visualizing posts reach and its relationship with other actors, channels and content. TGstat can pull up a specific channel's analytics and show the relationship between channels through the “citation” section. This section shows who cites whom. Some thematic similarities in content between channels overlap.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0192.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another way to see the relationship between channels is through the "similar channels" and “related channels” section of the profile in question.

\
In addition, users can see the popularity of a channel or group overtime.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0202.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>After finding individual channels, users can expand their search based on the "related channels" or "similar channels" feature</p></figcaption></figure>

_**Analytics:**_ TGStat assists in analyzing content and reach. It provides insight on the channel or group’s performance, such as subscriber numbers, subscribers acquired overtime or those acquired based on popularity of posts, reach, views per posts, and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) per individual posts. This enables the user to understand what type of content resonates with a particular audience.
