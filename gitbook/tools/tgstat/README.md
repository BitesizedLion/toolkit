TGStat is useful for discovery, especially for those monitoring events in Russian-speaking countries, post-Soviet regions, or far-right groups. It analyzes a diverse set of channels and groups. The statistics are constantly being refreshed and updated in [real-time](https://databar.ai/explore/tgstat).

_**What problem does it solve?**_

TGStat solves a discovery and time management issue. Telegram’s search function lacks advanced features and filters, making it difficult for unfamiliar users to find specific information. Success often relies on knowing local terminology and search nuances. However, TGStat can assist through discovery, comparison, and analytics.

**Discovery:** It assists researchers in finding relevant channels to follow on specific topics. Some features are:

1. _Filter by country:_ On TGStat, users can filter channels by country. The list of countries available in the search filters are: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, China, India, and Ethiopia.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0178.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>This shows a catalog of public Telegram channels and open groups categorzed by country. The user can navigate to this feature by clicking “Catalog” in the upper left, then clicking “channels and groups catalog”. </p></figcaption></figure>

However, users can find any public channel or open groups not covered by the countries listed in the catalog.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-06-24 170220.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This is a public news channel with a Telegram account. The screenshot shows the TGStat analytics for the channel. In the upper right corner, the "channel's geo and language" is displayed. The channel is primarily in Arabic, and the specific country is not mentioned. This means that users may not be able to find this channel by browsing the catalog grouped by country. Instead, they can search for the channel's username using the site's search bar. This demonstrates that TGStat provides information for public channels on Telegram, irrespective of their country and language.</p></figcaption></figure>

2. _Filter by theme/region:_ When researching Telegram channels in Russia, channels are grouped by region and by theme/topics. For the other countries, channels can be filtered by theme but not by regions.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0184.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>For Russia-based channels, users can filter by region as shown in the image. You can navigate through this by clicking "Catalog" in the upper left corner, and then by clicking on "regional compilations."</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0185.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>For Russia-based channels, users can filter by themes/subject as shown in the image. You can navigate through this by clicking "Catalog" in the upper left corner, and then by clicking on "thematic compilations."</p></figcaption></figure>

3. _Filter by rating:_ TGStat also has a rating system for channels, groups and posts. This in turn is a useful indicator of channel popularity and audience engagement.

_Channels rating:_ The top 100 Telegram channels (both public and private) are rated by the most number of subscribers, by growth, by reach, and by citation. Users can filter the growth metrics by daily growth, growth the previous day, weekly growth, and monthly growth. It also rates public channels by reach and citations. (how many times, a particular channel is mentioned by other channels). Users can filter channels by country or view global rankings. TGStat also rates the top 100 channels according to topic and similarly rates them according to the most number of subscribers, growth, reach and citation.

_Groups rating:_ Groups (public and private) are rated according to the most number of participants, by growth, by messages (number of messages in a group in the last 7 days), and by active participants (“MAU’s”- Monthly Active Users - which TGStat describes as “the number of unique users who have written at least one message in a group in the last 30 days”) .  And posts are rated by the most number of views, by shares including through personal messages, by most numbers of comments, by forwards to channels, and by reactions.&#x20;

_Posts rating_: Posts are rated by the most number of [views, by shares including through personal messages, by most numbers of comments, by forwards to channels, and by reactions](https://tgstat.ru/en/ratings/posts). \


**Comparison:** This tool also solves the problem of visualizing posts reach and its relationship with other user accounts, channels and content. TGstat can pull up a specific channel's analytics and show the relationship between accounts through the “citation” section. This section shows who cites whom.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0214.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>This image shows the “incoming mentions” on the left and “outgoing mentions” on the right.  The “incoming mentions” refer to the accounts that are discussing content from this channel. The “outgoing mentions” refer to the accounts that this channel in question is discussing. You can get to this feature by going to the main page of the channel you are researching, and clicking the blue bar called “Channel Statistics” on the right side of the page. Then clicking “Citation” on the menu to the left of the page.  </p></figcaption></figure>

Users can use this feature during the preplanning stage to find other channels that might give them more information for their research. It can also show users what the channel is trying to achieve and why.&#x20;

NOTE: That this feature is only available for Telegram channels and not for groups.&#x20;

Another way to see the relationship between channels is through the "similar channels" and “related channels” section of the profile in question.

\
In addition, users can see the popularity of a channel or group overtime.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0211.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>When trying to look for more information on a research topic, or to figure out which other channels may be discussing a particular incident under investigation, TGStat users can navigate the “similar channels” or “related channels”. This can be found on the main page of the user’s TGStat profile.  </p></figcaption></figure>

_**Analytics:**_ TGStat assists in analyzing content and reach. It provides insight on the channel or group’s performance, such as subscriber numbers, subscribers acquired overtime or those acquired based on popularity of posts, reach, views per posts, and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) per individual posts. This enables the user to understand what type of content resonates with a particular audience.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/IMG_0195 (1).PNG" alt=""><figcaption><p>This screenshot shows a TGStat feature called “Views Analysis”. This feature allows users to check a post’s popularity by date and by hour after it's been published. This feature can be accessed through the menu on the left of the page.</p></figcaption></figure>
