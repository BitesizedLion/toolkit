# Geolocation Estimation

## URL

[https://labs.tib.eu/geoestimation/](https://labs.tib.eu/geoestimation/)

## Description

**Geolocation Estimation** allows users to predict the location of an image using a deep-learning model. Select an image from 48 free samples or upload your own (by emailing Eric.Mueller@tib.eu for account registration). Place the **User Marker** on the map to make your best guess about where the photo was taken. Then, click **"Guess Location"** to see the results.&#x20;

The tool generates two or three markers depending on the photo. The **Model** Marker as the name suggests shows the location predicted by the deep-learning model. The **Ground Truth** marker indicates the actual location of the photo. Depending on the photo, it also displays an **Exif marker** if the image has metadata.

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

A user needs to make an account for uploading their images by emailing Eric.Mueller@tib.eu for registration.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

The tool is partially free as it provides 48 images for testing.

## Limitations

The tool has limitations in predicting or estimating the location of certain images. For example, after selecting an image of flowers in nature from the free samples, the Model marker predicts the location as Norway, while the Ground Truth marker indicates the location to be in California, USA, which can be misleading.

## **Guides and articles**

Steps for using the tool are provided under the **Instructions** tab**.** The tool provider has also shared a document for the deep-learning model for those interested in taking a deep dive into how it works [here](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content\_ECCV\_2018/papers/Eric\_Muller-Budack\_Geolocation\_Estimation\_of\_ECCV\_2018\_paper.pdf).
