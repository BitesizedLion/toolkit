{% hint style="info" %}
D**isambiguation:** This article describes a web-based app called OrbTrack, written by Torsten Hoffman (author of popular app [SunCalc](https://app.gitbook.com/o/WQpOq5ZFue4N6m65QCJq/s/ScmcEIAcsvKXg7S4xa8P/)) which displays data on over 10,000 satellites in a graphical interface for a time period 5 days ahead of the use date. It does not cover the mobile app of the same name, written by James Nikolai, stored on GitHub.

## Description

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/StillImageAnnotated2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>THE ORBTRACK INTERFACE</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Satellites can carry many different forms of sensor, e.g. photographic imaging, heat (Infra-red) imaging, LIDAR  (Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging) imaging, SAR ([Synthetic Aperture Radar](https://www.keysight.com/blogs/en/inds/2020/08/28/what-is-synthetic-aperture-radar)) imaging,... Not all of these require the earth to be in sunlight to collect useful data. Some of these can operate successfully in the presence of cloud cover.

{% tab title="USE CASES" %}
**Verifying Satellite Data:**&#x20;

**Locating and Selecting Useful Satellite Data**

**Location-Focused Research:**&#x20;

Finding satellites which pass over an area of interest at an angle of elevation useful to the user.



Find the location for a given satellite at user-defined angles (azimuth and election) and date & time

Testing whether a satellite passes over an area of interest at a particular angle of elevation (and therefore may reveal sensor detail of the Earth's surface which was previously unavailable)

**Satellite-Focused Research:**&#x20;

Finding the path of a given satellite, including the high level information as to whether it is in or near geostationary orbit.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>

The OrbTrack interface is not difficult to use: the difficulty rating reflects the contextual understanding required to use OrbTrack effectively. This includes concepts around satellites, their orbits, their position relative to the Earth and the Sun, the different types of sensors they carry, how imaging is affected by elevation angle, etc.&#x20;

## Requirements

None. OrbTrack does not require any form of login or registration.

## Limitations

**Time Limited:**OrbTrack provides satellite path data for 5 days ahead of the date upon which it is being used. It cannot provide historical data or forward predictions past this point.

**No "Reverse Search":** OrbTrack allows the user to find information about a particular satellite over a particular time period, but search within this space needs to be done by trial and error: for example, OrbTrack will not take as inputs the co-ordinates of a given location and a given angle of elevation and return the list of satellites whose paths fulfil this angle to that location within the next 5 days.

## Ethical Considerations

By its nature, satellite imaging can be intrusive and be used to focus attention on locations and people which could prove unwelcome or difficult to manage.
