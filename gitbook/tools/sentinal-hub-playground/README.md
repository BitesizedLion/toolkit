## Description

Copernicus Browser and EO Browser provide a browser-based GUI to visualise Sentinel and other satellite data. Every workflow starts by choosing relevant datasets, searching by location (determined by zooming into the map), timespan, and optionally cloud cover. Once data has been selected, the platform contains a toolkit to measure and visualise different features.

One convenient feature is the inclusion of imaging indices, including the NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index). These create false-colour images from information outside of the visible spectrum that allow for changes in vegetation coverage and water quality to be measured.

For a guide on using the tool to create a timelapse, Annique Moussou's recent [guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/05/17/how-to-use-free-satellite-imagery-to-monitor-the-expansion-of-west-bank-settlements/) to using free satellite imagery to monitor the expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank is a good place to start.

Confusingly, there are two linked browser-based tools that afford a very similar interface to Sentinel data: EO Browser, and Copernicus Browser. Older links to the 'Sentinel Hub Playground' will redirect to Copernicus Browser.

At present, EO Browser and Copernicus Browser are functionally very similar, though EO Browser also allows the inclusion of non-Sentinel satellite datasets such as Landsat and MODIS, and the inclusion of commercial data. EO Browser requires a login, and is part of Sentinel's Planet Insights platform, which has a paid tier. Copernicus Browser allows use with or without an account and does not at present have a paid tier. The splitting-off of these separate platforms is relatively recent; time will tell if their features will diverge in any significant way.

## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

EO Browser has a paid tier, Copernicus Browser is free.

## Level of difficulty

## Requirements

For Copernicus Browser -- just a browser. To use EO Browser, an email login is required, though this is free to obtain.

## Limitations

Copernicus Browser is limited to Sentinel Data, while EO Browser is not -- however to obtain higher-resolution satellite imagery, you need to access the paid tier.&#x20;

Because these tools are a browser-based GUI and do not have an option to write code, there is a fine-grained control and customisation afforded by more specialised tools such as [Google Earth Engine](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/google-earth-engine) (code-based) or [QGIS](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/qgis) (desktop application).

## Ethical Considerations

Like any tool using remote sensing data, it's important to remember that a satellite image is not a panacea, and is best supported with additional information from the ground. In particular, the use of indices and spectral signatures to draw conclusions about the presence or not of different chemicals, minerals or matter should also be corroborated with other data.

EO Browser's availability of high-resolution satellite imagery involves further questions about anonymity and surveillance, as the resolution of e.g. Planet Labs imagery is sufficient to track individual vehicles.
