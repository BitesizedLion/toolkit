# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
  "name": "Amnesty YouTube Dataviewer",
  "url": "http://amnestyusa.org/sites/default/custom-scripts/citizenevidence",
  "description": "Reverse image (video still) search and exact uploading time. Hereâ€™s an Advanced Guide on Verifying Video Content.",
  "cost": "Free",

{% endcode %}

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in light blue font) and do not change the key names (left side, slightly darker blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition". Seperate tags with a comma `,`.

If a tool is completely free to use, include the tag "free".
