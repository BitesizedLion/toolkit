description: <p>Site owner Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project<br>An investigative data platform that helps reporters 'follow the money'. They provide public access to a vast archive of government records and open databases. However, much of the Aleph archive is protected from public access due to concerns about data protection. Reporters and researchers can upload their own files to private investigations, extract text, sketch a diagram, to summarize their investigative findings, and cross-reference persons of interest and companies. You need to apply for full access.</p>
