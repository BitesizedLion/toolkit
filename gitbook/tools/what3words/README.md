## Description

A very simple and rapid way to communicate locations on earth. The world has been divided into 3m x 3m squares (around 57 trillion of them), and an unique identifier combining three words is assigned to each one. An API (Application Programming Interface) is available to allow the conversion between what3word addresses and geographic co-ordinates.

What3words is used to summon the emergecy services, e.g. Mountain Rescue, pinpoint meeting places, specify accurate deliveries, e.g. Hermes and Ikea use it, and advertise accurate locations. Its use in Open Source research can cover any ofthese applications for the technology, as part of an investigation.

## Limitations

Recent research on what3words has revealed some flaws in the system which aims not to assign similar 3 word phrases to nearby areas. Similarity also includes homophones, i.e. words which sound similar, rather than look similar. This is because what3words is used to communicate over voice channels, particularly for the emergency services.

The [BBC reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56901363) that a researcher had found 'thousands' of 3 word phrases which were either very similar looking, or similar sounding, had been assigned to locations less than 1km  apart.&#x20;
