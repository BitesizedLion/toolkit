## Description

A very simple and rapid way to communicate locations on earth. The world has been divided into 3m x 3m squares (around 57 trillion of them), and an unique identifier combining three words is assigned to each one. The app is available for PC browsers and mobile phones and an API (Application Programming Interface) is available to automate the conversion between what3word addresses and geographic co-ordinates.

What3words can be used to summon the emergecy services, e.g. Mountain Rescue, pinpoint meeting places, specify accurate deliveries, e.g. Hermes and Ikea use it, and advertise accurate locations. Its use in Open Source research can cover any of these applications for the technology, as part of an investigation.

The Interface

{% tab title="USE CASES" %}
* Input a location and convert it to another format
* Input a location and share it via a selection of media
* Save a location to a user account
* Navigate a journey using a location
* Copy a location
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="USER INPUT OPTIONS" %}
* Type co-ordinates
* Type 3 word phase

Using the yellow pin man icon on the map displays any Google Maps imagery relating to the location selected.

## Requirements

Users wishing to use the facility to save locations will need an account, which is free to set up.

Apps and browsers need permissions to detect the user's current location for certain functionality to be available.

## Limitations

Recent research on what3words has revealed some flaws in the system which aims not to assign similar 3 word phrases to nearby areas. Similarity also includes homophones, i.e. words which sound similar, rather than look similar. This is because what3words is used to communicate over voice channels, particularly for the emergency services.

The [BBC reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56901363) that a researcher had found 'thousands' of 3 word phrases which were either very similar looking, or similar sounding, had been assigned to locations less than 1km  apart.&#x20;
