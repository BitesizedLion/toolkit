<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Need to install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) in your environment, which the download instructions on Ghunt's Github ensures. &#x20;

## Limitations

Beginning in April 2024, Ghunt no longer shows the name of the account holder in the resolts it returns. GHunt developers commented that this was a feature that Google has actively tried to block, as a result users were advised to not expect the return of this feature. \
Some social media users have speculated that the removal of this feature may be related to an April 2024 [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/05/top-israeli-spy-chief-exposes-his-true-identity-in-online-security-lapse) by the Guardian which identified the head of Israel's Unit 8200, an intelligence and surveillance apparatus under the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). According to the investigative methodology described in the article, Ghunt may have ostensibly been used to identify Sariel.
