## Description

ImageJ is a powerful, open-source image processing program, widely used in fields like biology, engineering, and open-source intelligence (OSINT). Developed initially for scientific analysis, ImageJ offers an extensive suite of tools for analyzing, processing, and measuring visual data. It is a versatile resource for researchers needing precision measurements or object counting.

**Key Features for Counting and Measuring**

1. **Object Counting**
   * ImageJ can efficiently count objects in an image using tools like thresholding and particle analysis.
   * Users can set parameters such as size, shape, and contrast to automate the counting process for diverse scenarios.
2. **Measuring Dimensions**
   * Tools like line and polygon measurement allow users to calculate distances, perimeters, and areas directly on images.
   * Image calibration ensures measurements reflect real-world scales, critical for forensic and investigative purposes.
3. **Batch Processing**
   * ImageJ's macro capabilities enable repetitive tasks, such as counting objects in a series of images, to be automated, saving time in large-scale projects.
