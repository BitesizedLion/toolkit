description: The official Italian companies registry and offers a wide array of basic information and data companyâ€™s purpose, legal email address, locations (legal HQ and operative offices or warehouses, etc). A few times it reports the date of establishment or when a company started providing a specific service/activity. It is only in Italian but has a very easy interface. The basic searching service is free, but it is possible to buy reports and specific information about a company. Same old story as for any other national registry.
