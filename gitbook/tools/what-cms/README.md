## Description

Whatcms is a tool that you can use to identify the technologies used to power a website. \
A couple of examples of what the website is able to detect:\
Content Management Systems (CMS)\
Programming languages\
Specific plugins

The website will help you understand what CMS is being used and to identify the less visible components. This information can help to create a digital footprint of an individual or organization or track changes over time.&#x20;

Paid subscriptions also allow Batch processing which will allows the user to upload lists of URL's to be analysed simultaneously. It also has Private Detections which gives you the option to detect other technologies such as databases.



## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

The website has a free version with limited features which allows 500 detections and the API will allow you to request 1 URL every 10 seconds. \
The paid subscriptions range from 15 to 600 euros per month, with options for Batch Processing and Private Detections.&#x20;

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

You can use the basic features on the website for free, but registration is necessary if you want to use the API or other functions.&#x20;

## Limitations

According to their own website, there are some limitations. Websites that use custom CMS's or security measures to hide their technologies might not be detected accurately. The free version also has limited usage which could restrict further/broader research.

## Ethical Considerations

Like every tool, ensure that the use of the tool is within the law, the site's terms of services, and ethical OSINT guidelines.
