## Description

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/oPTIMISEDShadowMap Gif.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>SHADOWMAP TILTING VIEW DEMONSTRATING AZIMUTH &#x26; ELEVATION ANGLES IN 3D</p></figcaption></figure>

ShadowMap calculates shadow locations in real time and displays them on a 3D tilting map, showing arcs of azimuth and elevation angles along the sun's path.&#x20;

### Free and Paid Shadowmap Versions

A range of more  advanced functions are spread across 3 further paid versions with increasing numbers of features - see the table below, \[click the tab for each version to show functionality.]

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="FREE VERSION" %}
<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/VersionsTablefREE1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>COMPARING THE FOUR VERSIONS OF SHADOWMAP: FREE, EXPLORER, HOME &#x26; STUDIO</p></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="EXPLORER" %}
<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/VersionsTableEXPLORER2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="HOME" %}
<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/VersionsTableHOME3v3.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="STUDIO" %}
<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/VersionsTableSTUDIO4 (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The Main Differences between versions are:

* The Free version is restricted to today's date, but the user can define the time of day.
* The Explorer version allows any input date and time, past or future.
* The Home version includes 3D buildings in 3 cities, plus satellite backround maps.
* The Studio version allows 3D user model upload and Google hi-res satellite imagery.

{% hint style="success" %}
All Shadowmap functionality, up to and including the top level Studio version, is available to **test for free** in a single selected location (Chile, at the time of writing, though this may be amended over time)
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="INPUT DATA" %}
* Location (co-ordinates/name/map pin)
* Date
* Time
* User Object Description (vertices & height)
* User's own 3D model files
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OUTPUT DATA" %}
* Shadow pattern for buildings and landscape at a given location and time.
* 24 hour animation of the sun and shadow paths at a given location and time
* Yearly average solar energy value for a given location in kWh/square metre

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="USE CASES" %}
* Matching an image containing shadows to determine the relationship between date, time and shadow pattern
* Projecting potential shadow patterns at user-defined location, date and time.
* Finding the annual average solar energy value for a given location. Examples where this would be useful are: to determine likely type of vegetation, to determine likelihood of snowfall, to determine suitability for solar power generation,...

### The Interface

ShadowMap has 5 main interface menus:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="PROJECT " %}
<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/ProjectsandShareMenu (1).jpg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Project and Share menus allow&#x20;

* a model containing user data to be saved as a project, and to share or embed that project with default time, date, camera angle, focal length, etc. Shared models are not editable by the audience, but interaction is allowed.&#x20;
* links & embeds can be updated simultaneously via the "Update" button&#x20;
* the user to create a shape in Shadowmap
* the user to upload a model into Shadowmap
* the user to edit buildings in the map for visibility and height
{% endtab %}

### The Data

Custom models (within a quota dependent upon subscription plan) up to 200MB can be uploaded in formats:

[GLB](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/glb/), [FBX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX), [DAE,](https://cadexchanger.com/dae/) [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront\_.obj\_file), and[ IFC](https://www.spatial.com/resources/glossary/what-is-ifc)

Users have the option to select any building on the map and adjust its height or hide it from view.



## Cost

## Requirements

\[\[Information on the requirement for using a tool, for instance, API key, e-mail address etc.]]

## Limitations

Fixed date (as the date of the system clock) in the free version is a major limitation of ShadowMap for Open Source investigation, because source imagery is rarely created and analysed on the same day.
