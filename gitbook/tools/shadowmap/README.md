## Description

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/oPTIMISEDShadowMap Gif.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>SHADOWMAP TILTING VIEW DEMONSTRATING AZIMUTH &#x26; ELEVATION ANGLES IN 3D</p></figcaption></figure>

ShadowMap calculates shadow locations in real time and displays them on a 3D tilting map, showing arcs of azimuth and elevation angles along the sun's path.&#x20;

A range of more  advanced functions are spread across 3 further paid versions with increasing numbers of features.

The free version allows the user to change the time of day, but is fixed to use the date at which it is being used.
