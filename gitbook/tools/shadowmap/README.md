## Description

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/oPTIMISEDShadowMap Gif.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>SHADOWMAP TILTING VIEW DEMONSTRATING AZIMUTH &#x26; ELEVATION ANGLES IN 3D</p></figcaption></figure>

ShadowMap calculates shadow locations in real time and displays them on a 3D tilting map, showing arcs of azimuth and elevation angles along the sun's path.&#x20;

A range of more  advanced functions are spread across 3 further paid versions with increasing numbers of features - see the table below, with a tab for each version explaining funcationality.

The Main Differences between versions are:

* The Explorer version allows any input date and time, past or future
* The Home version includes 3D buildings in 3 cities, plus satellite backround maps
* The Studio version allows 3D user model upload and Google hi-res satellite imagery

{% hint style="success" %}
All Shadowmap functionality, up to Studio version, is available to test for free in a single selected location (Chile, at the time of writing, though this may be amended over time)
{% endhint %}

## Limitations

Fixed date (as the date of the system clock) in the free version is a major limitation of ShadowMap for Open Source investigation, because source imagery is rarely created and analysed on the same day.
