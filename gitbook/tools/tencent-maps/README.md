## Limitations

Tencent Maps, while a comprehensive tool for mapping and geographic data, has several limitations that researchers should be aware of:

* **API Rate Limits**: There is a cap on the number of API calls that can be made within a certain timeframe with a concurrency limit: 5 times/second/interface/Key Daily and calls: 10,000 times/interface/Key. For researchers requiring high-frequency data access, this might pose a limitation (see [here](https://lbs-qq-com.translate.goog/faq/accountQuota/faqKey?\_x\_tr\_sl=auto&\_x\_tr\_tl=en&\_x\_tr\_hl=en&\_x\_tr\_hist=true)).
* **Access speed**: International users will experience slower access speeds or need a Chinese IP address to access certain APIs. The Chinese government's [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Firewall) slows traffic plus Baidu's servers [are hosted China, not on a distributed content network (CDN)](https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/736/why-are-sites-like-youku-and-baidu-so-slow-overseas) so the distance to the nearest server is a factor.
* **Data Availability**: The coverage and detail level of map data is limited and offers maps only of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan and varies by region. In some rural or less developed areas, data might be scarce or outdated (see: [Wikipedia Tencent Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent\_Maps)).&#x20;
* **Commercial Use**: For projects with commercial intentions or that require extensive data usage, there might be licensing fees or additional restrictions. [https://www.tencentcloud.com/](https://www.tencentcloud.com/) provides information on each service (in Chinese).
* **Language and Documentation**: The primary language (including for documentation and support) is Chinese, which may present a barrier for non-Chinese speaking researchers.
* **Geographical Restrictions**: Certain data or features might be restricted outside of China due to legal or licensing issues (see: [Restrictions on geographic data in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions\_on\_geographic\_data\_in\_China)).&#x20;
* **No longitude and latitude:** Chinese national regulations do not allow the public provision of maps with longitude and latitude (see: [Restrictions on geographic data in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions\_on\_geographic\_data\_in\_China)).&#x20;
* **No Desktop Version:** the desktop version was [shutdown in 2022](https://36kr.com/p/1971614184967305).&#x20;

Researchers should evaluate these limitations against their project requirements to determine if Tencent Maps is the right tool for their needs.

## Ethical Considerations

When using Tencent Maps for research or commercial purposes, it's important to take into account several ethical considerations:

* **Accuracy**: Acknowledging the limitations in data accuracy and the potential impact this may have on research outcomes or decisions made based on this data  (see: [Restrictions on geographic data in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions\_on\_geographic\_data\_in\_China)).
* **Fair Use**: Respecting the terms of service regarding the fair use of Tencent Maps data, including limitations on data scraping and the use of data for commercial purposes without proper licensing.
* **Cultural Sensitivity and Bias**: Being aware of and sensitive to the cultural and political context of geographic data, especially in regions with disputed territories or sensitive areas.
* **Privacy Concerns**: Like many mapping services, Tencent Maps gathers user data, which raises questions about data privacy and protection. [Worried about Huawei? Take a closer look at Tencent](https://freedomhouse.org/article/worried-about-huawei-take-closer-look-tencent).
* **Censorship and Content Control**: Being a Chinese company, Tencent Maps may adhere to government censorship laws, affecting the type of content available or omitted. More information [here](https://protonvpn.com/blog/great-firewall-china).

Researchers and professionals should ensure their use of Tencent Maps aligns with broader ethical guidelines and considerations relevant to their specific field or industry.
