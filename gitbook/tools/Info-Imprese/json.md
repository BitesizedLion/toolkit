# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
  "name": "Info Imprese",
  "url": "http://infoimprese.it/",
  "description": "A second database of Italian companies that basically reflects registroimprese.it. Offers the same service of registroimprese.it, but it often reports more details about a companyâ€™s activity and purpose, which can help a lot in the investigation. It is perfect to validate the results you may have previously found on registroimprese.it.",
  "details": "Registry, Italy",
  "tags": [
    "registry",
    "companies-and-finance",
    "italy"
  ]

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in dark blue font). Do not change the key names (left side, slightly light blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition". Seperate tags with a comma `,`.

If a tool is completely free to use, include the tag "free".
