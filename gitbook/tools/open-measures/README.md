## Ethical Considerations

When using Open Measures for research purposes, it's imperative to consider the following ethical aspects:

* **Privacy and Consent**: Although Open Measures archives public posts, researchers should be mindful of the privacy expectations of individuals who made those posts. Not all users understand or anticipate their contributions being analyzed or quoted in research.
* **Bias and Representativeness**: Acknowledge that the data collected from Open Measures may not be representative of broader populations or viewpoints. Research findings should be contextualized within the scope and limitations of the data source.
* **Ethical Use of Content**: Be cautious and respectful when using content that may be sensitive, offensive, or controversial. Researchers should critically evaluate the necessity and implications of including such content in their work.
* **The Oxygen of Amplification**_**:**_ Think carefully about what you publish not to unwittingly amplify some of the messaging present on 4Chan (see: Phillips, W. (2018) _The Oxygen of Amplification_, _Data & Society_. Data & Society Research Institute. Available at: [https://datasociety.net/library/oxygen-of-amplification/](https://datasociety.net/library/oxygen-of-amplification/) (Accessed: 22 April 2024)).

Considering these ethical guidelines will help maintain the integrity of your research and protect the rights and dignity of individuals whose posts might be included in your study.
