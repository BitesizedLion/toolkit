# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
    "url": "https://www.maltego.com/",
    "description":"Maltego is both a search tool and a visualization tool. It can search for information and connect the pieces to show you how they are related." 
    "tags": ["data visualization", "social-media", "visualization", "email-address", "alias", "phone-number", "public-record"]
}
```
{% endcode %}

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in dark blue font). Do not change the key names (left side, slightly light blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;
