## Description

Apple Maps can be useful for open source researchers due to its high-resolution imagery and detailed mapping capabilities. Here are some features of interest:

* **High-Resolution Imagery:** Provides clear satellite views, useful for analyzing geographical and structural details.
* **Detailed City Data:** Includes 3D views and indoor maps of significant landmarks, airports, and shopping centers.
* **Search Functions:** Location search by name, coordinates, or landmarks.
* **Environmental Data:** Offers data on air quality and weather, helpful for tracking environmental conditions in specific areas.
* **Privacy-Focused:** Ensures that data collected from usage isn't tied to user profiles, maintaining researcher anonymity. See [Apple Map's Privacy](https://www.apple.com/maps/) and the [Apple Privacy terms](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).&#x20;

Features (MacOS and mobile):

* **3D view**

### Use Cases

Apple Maps, with its rich features and extensive data, can be a powerful tool in the realm of open source research. Here are some potential use cases:

* **Geolocation Verification:** Verifying the location of a photo or video shared on social media to confirm the authenticity of claims made online.
* **Investigative Reporting:** Tracking and mapping out relevant locations to a story, thereby providing readers with a clearer understanding of the spatial relationships and geographical details of the investigation.
* **Historical Analysis:** Comparing current maps with historical data to highlight changes over time in areas of interest, which can add depth to stories on urban development, environmental changes, or socio-economic shift.
* **Infrastructure Analysis:** Analyzing satellite images and 3D maps of infrastructure for changes or developments that might indicate political, military, or economic events.
* **Environmental Monitoring:** Monitoring changes in landscapes, forest cover, water bodies, etc., to report on environmental issues or natural disasters.

## Requirements

* Web: any modern web browser
* Mobile: iOS
* Developer Platform: Apple account with email address and a credit card.

## Limitations

* **Coverage**: While Apple Maps has significantly improved its coverage over the years, there are still some regions, particularly in developing countries, where the map data might not be as detailed or up-to-date as in the US or Europe. Apple's [Feature Availability Page](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/) documents Apple Map's coverage.&#x20;
* **Look Around (Street View)**: Apple Maps' _Look Around_ feature, similar to Google's Street View, is not as widely available globally. Its coverage is limited to major cities and places of interest. Apple's [Feature Availability Page](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/) documents Apple's _Look Around_ coverage and their [Apple Maps Image Collection](https://maps.apple.com/imagecollection/gb.) page detail where and when images are being collected.&#x20;
* **Cross-Platform Availability**: Apple Maps is primarily available on iOS, macOS, and watchOS devices. Its limited availability on non-Apple platforms could be a drawback for users seeking cross-platform compatibility. Windows users can use [Apple Maps on the web](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/apple-maps-on-the-web-launches-in-beta/) (in beta) or have a look at [satellites.pro](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/satellites.pro).
* **Limited Web Version:** the web version (Apple Maps on the web) lacks significant functionality like searching and street view.
* **Screenshots Use:** screenshots may be used for non-commercial purposes but must be attributed e.g. Map data © 2024 Apple Inc.. For more information see [Apple Maps Terms of Use](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/maps/terms-en.html).
* **API Rate Limits:** the developer API has rate limits for more information, see [Apple Maps Server API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemapsserverapi/). &#x20;
* **API Use:** the Apple Maps API has specific restrictions on things like caching, see the [Apple Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/) on this and for information about commercial use.

## Ethical Considerations

Open source researchers using Apple Maps should consider the following ethical implications:

* **Bias and Representation**: The limited coverage in developing countries and the focus on major cities and tourist attractions can lead to an implicit bias, portraying a skewed image of the world. Researchers should be mindful of this in their reporting and seek to provide a balanced view. See [The world probably doesn’t look like you think it does — and that matters, a lot](https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2021/7/2/22537588/map-bias-the-world-probably-doesnt-look-like-you-think/)  and [Not All Digital Maps Are the Same](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/not-all-digital-maps-are-the-same).&#x20;
