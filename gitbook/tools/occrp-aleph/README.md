## Description

Aleph is a platform by OCCRP to help journalists and investigators "follow the money". It provides access to many datasets on people and companies, and offers tools to organize and visualize data. Investigators can use Aleph to search sanctions lists, corporate registries, leaks, and more. They can also create workspaces to collaborate and upload their own data to cross-reference with Aleph's datasets.&#x20;

Aleph provides a range of tools and mechanisms to aid investigations. They are simple to use, but familiarizing yourself with the different tools and their functions may take some time.

## Requirements

No account is necessary to use Aleph.&#x20;

Some datasets are only accessible to approved users. To be approved, you must sign up using [this form](https://form.asana.com/?k=hsYmAKHX1ViTzUoe410y8Q\&d=24418422500834).&#x20;

## Limitations

• The OCCRP has restricted access to certain datasets. Access to protected materials can be granted to investigative journalists, activists, or researchers.

• Leaked datasets by nature are not always complete, and are thus imperfect sources.&#x20;

• Some data types are not compatible with Aleph

## Ethical Considerations

While leaked datasets can provide valuable insights and foster transparency, they often involve sensitive and personal information obtained without consent. Thus, making use of these datasets can harm individuals whose data has been exposed. It is therefore imperative to weigh the public interest against privacy violations and ensure data is handled responsibly, with respect for legal and ethical standards.
