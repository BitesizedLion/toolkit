## Description

Archive.today is a web archiving service that allows users to manually save snapshots of webpages. Each snapshot keeps an exact copy of the page as it looked at that moment, including text, images, and design. This way the content is preserved, even if the original page changes or is taken down. For open source researchers, Archive.today is a reliable way to save online information for future reference.



#### Features

**Snapshot Creation:** You can save a page by entering the URL, and Archive.today creates a link to a permanent, static copy of the website.\
The following parts of the website are saved in the snapshot:\
1\. Textual content of the web page.

2\. Images.

3\. Content of the frames.

4\. Content and images loaded or generated by Javascript on Web 2.0 sites

5\. Screenshot of 1024x768 pixels.

**Searchable Archive:** Previous snapshots are searchable, making it easy to find and review earlier versions of a page.

**Time Travel:** You can check earlier versions of a page to track how content has changed over time.&#x20;

**Browser Extension:** There’s a browser extension for quick snapshots, so you don’t have to go through the main site each time. The extension will open a new tab in your browser and will start archiving right away. You can also right click on a page and in the menu you will see the option to archive or search the link.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Archive.today doesn’t require a lot, only an internet connection, a browser and the URL of the public page you want to archive. Pages behind a login might not capture well.

## Limitations

**Some Parts of a Website Cannot be Saved:**\
1\. Flash and content loaded by flash.

2\. Video and sounds. It has no sense to archive youtube.com unless you want to archive the title of the video and comments. The video itself will not be saved.

3\. PDF files&#x20;

4\. RSS and other XML-pages saved are not reliable. Most of them are not saved or saved as a blank page.

**Slower At Peak Times:** When service is busy, it can be slower to respond, so archiving may take longer.





## Ethical Considerations

There are several Ethical Considerations to keep in mind while using archive.today. A snapshot might capture private information and it could also archive copyrighted material without permission.
