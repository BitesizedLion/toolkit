## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

For individual and corporation searches, the tool requires a name and at least one other piece of identifiable information (ie, social media username, phone number, email, address, city, etc)

## Limitations

Data returned is limited to publicly available information, and requires a fair amount of due diligence before being included in a final report. The best way to work with this tool is to think of it as a centralized search engine across several different methodologies (public records, dark web leaks, social media platforms) that allows you to exclude results as you investigate them further.

## Ethical Considerations

The ethical considerations of each tool should be described.

## Guide

Skopenow hosts a free ongoing [webinar series](https://www.skopenow.com/skopenow-webinar-series) that provides instructions on how to use various features of the product, as well as how the product intersects with different investigative methodologies.

On the company website, there are also a series of [guides and reports](https://www.skopenow.com/guides-and-reports) related to OSINT methodologies that are free to access.
