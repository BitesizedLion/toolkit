## Description

**Search4Faces** is a facial recognition search engine that allows users to find the profile photos of individuals across various online platforms. The tool is implemented in Python and is accessible via a web interface or as a Python library. Key features of Search4Faces include:

1. **Face Recognition Search**:.
   * Searches through multiple databases, including those of social networks (VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, TikTok, and Clubhouse), to find similar faces.
   * Users can specify which database to search in, and results include links to the relevant social media profiles.
2. **Customization and API Integration**:
   * Search4Faces offers an API that can be integrated into applications for automated and scalable facial recognition searches.
   * The API supports asynchronous operations and provides customizable search parameters, such as limiting the number of results or specifying whether to include hidden profiles in the search results.
   * The tool can also be configured for more targeted searches, depending on the databases and permissions set by the user.

## Cost

* [ ] Free

## Requirements

* API can be accessed after purchasing a plan or contacting their team for trial access. The API uses JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol over HTTPS, and you can interact with it using client libraries available for Python and PHP.
* No requirements for using the search features on the site itself.

## Limitations

* Image data for each social networking site is not updated in real-time, most datasets end around 2022. Certain user profiles can evade detection by changing their details.&#x20;
* The tool relies on other parameters (such as, age and gender) to improve results, using estimates of the values may limit its accuracy.
* You cannot search multiple databases at once.

## Ethical Considerations

* Persons with similar faces can be misidentified without accounting for other contextual information.
* Results can leak personally identifiable information such as general location, home address or the same of associated persons.
