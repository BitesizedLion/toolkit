## Description

**Search4Faces** is an open-source facial recognition search engine that allows users to find photos of individuals across various online platforms. The tool is implemented in Python and is accessible via a web interface or as a Python library. Key features of Search4Faces include:

1. **Face Recognition Search**:.
   * Searches through multiple databases, including those of social networks (VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, TikTok, and Clubhouse), to find similar faces or exact matches.
   * Users can specify which database to search in, and results include links to the relevant social media profiles
2. **Customization and API Integration**:
   * Search4Faces offers an API that can be integrated into applications for automated and scalable facial recognition searches.
   * The API supports asynchronous operations and provides customizable search parameters, such as limiting the number of results or specifying whether to include hidden profiles in the search results.
   * The tool can also be configured for more targeted searches, depending on the databases and permissions set by the user.&#x20;
