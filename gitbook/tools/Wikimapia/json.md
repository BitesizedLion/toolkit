# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
  "name": "Wikimapia",
  "url": "http://wikimapia.org/",
  "description": "Crowdsourced information related to geographic locations. Possibility to switch between Google/Bing/OSM. Massive amount of UCG information. Can be laggy, and need to refresh page after a view searches. Lost Google API.",
  "cost": "Free",

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in dark blue font). Do not change the key names (left side, slightly light blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition". Seperate tags with a comma `,`.

If a tool is completely free to use, include the tag "free".
