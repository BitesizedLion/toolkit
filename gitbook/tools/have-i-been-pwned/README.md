# Have I Been Pwned?

## Description

Have I Been Pwned allows you to search across multiple data breaches to see if your email address or phone number has been compromised.  It searches through over 700 websites and more than 100,000 pastes. When you search for an email address or phone number, the screen will either turn green, indicating no compromised accounts found, or red, indicating compromised accounts. If the screen turns red, you'll see a list of platforms or websites where your account details were compromised, along with additional information on when and what kind of data was affected.&#x20;

This tool is especially useful for finding where a person of interest had accounts and using those for further research. Say you have an email address you want to investigate. By running it on HIBP you find they had breaches on Twitter, Duolingo, and Last.fm -- this means they had accounts on those platforms and you can start researching these further until you find the connected accounts on the platforms.  HIPB is a starting point for researching email addresses / phone numbers.&#x20;

## Cost

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

None

## Limitations

The result page only shows the type of data breached - "username", "ip address", "password", it does not show you the breached data itself. If you are interested in those there are websites that collect the breached databases and let users perform searches (usually for a fee).&#x20;

"Whilst HIBP is kept up to date with as much data as possible, it contains but a small subset of all the records that have been breached over the years" [source](https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs). Hence, do not expect to see all the data breaches in this website. Again use this tool as the starting point of your research into an email address/ phone number.&#x20;
