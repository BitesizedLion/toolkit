Yandex Maps is a mapping service provided on the Russian-owned integrated Yandex platform, which also offers services on Image Search, Video Search, Translation/Interpretation, Weather,... Its stated focus is primarily on cities (but remote areas seem covered to a good standard also), and also organisations. Its global data is generally stronger and more detailed around Russia, Eastern Europe and Asia, in contrast with Google's mapping tools, which are stronger in Western Europe and North America. Yandex Maps has a different interface from Google mapping tools, most noticeably:

* **No Google "Yellow Man" to fix a StreetView location:** the absence of the Google 'yellow man' figure to drag and drop into a location as a means of viewing "Streetview" imagery stored there.
* **Satellite Sources:** Some Yandex Maps imagery clearly differs from that provided by platforms like Google, though Yandex does not publicly disclose the satellite proviers.&#x20;
* **"StreetView" Type Route "Videos"**: the presence of "Mirrors" in Yandex Maps, i.e. sequences of Street level images which can be run like a video of a journey along a route. These are posted by users, and are generally more like the [Mapillary app](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=20\&lng=0\&z=1.5), i.e. taken with a small field of view, usually from either a car dashcam showing only the road ahead in the direction of travel or a mobile phone moving with a pedestrian on a footpath. Yandex Maps allows filtering between Car and Pedestrian "Mirrors".
* **Geographic Orientation on Imagery:** the presence of Street Panoramas and Photos in Yandex Maps, which are similar to Google mapping tools functionality. HOWEVER, Yandex Maps includes graphic indicators on the direction and field of view of the imagery posted, which is not available for Google photospheres in Google Earth, and helps greatly with geolocation research.
* **Links and Embed Code for Panoramas:** Yandex Maps provides links and embed code to allow easy reference to a given panorama.
* **Restricted Historical Imagery:** historical image data is available, as in Google tools, and it can be filtered by year, BUT it is generally restricted to one undated image per year without information which would pinpoint the season.
* **Categorised Aerial Views:** Yandex distinguishes surface photography from airborne photography, e.g. drones, hot air balloons, aircraft through the use of separate icons for each.
* **User Storage re Calendar and Business:** Yandex promotes user interaction, where users can store and open online appointments and bookings, promote their businesses, post advertisements, create custom maps, post reviews, upload photos and even edit the map.
* **Supported User Map Edit:** Registered Yandex Users are also provided with a mobile phone app and a training video on how to create and upload photos of cities or streets which don't yet have local imagery on Yandex. These are moderated after uploading, then added to Yandex Maps.
* **Moving Transport:** Yandex includes Real Time Public Transport simulation.
