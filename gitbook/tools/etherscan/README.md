# Etherscan

The Ethereum address (https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045) of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin according to Forbes ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-moves-13-billion-worth-of-ether-but-where/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-moves-13-billion-worth-of-ether-but-where/))URL

## Description

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network with its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) currently being the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of value. Open source researchers can use Etherscan to look up data on the Ethereum blockchain, for instance addresses, transactions, smart [contract addresses](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) and more.

&#x20;**Addresses**

By typing in any Ether address in the search bar, researchers get amongst other information an overview of the current balance of the walletâ€™s assets in Ether and USD, the dates when the first and the last transactions were sent and an overview of all transactions.

**Ethereum usernames**

&#x20;Since the Ether address is long and not very user-friendly, there are services (like [Ethereum name service](https://ens.domains/)) that allow users to buy a username ending with .eth. If someone has such a username, researchers do not necessarily need to know the Ether address but can simply search for this name on Etherscan. Some Ethereum fans use their .eth username on other social media platforms which can be helpful to trace digital footprints during open source investigations. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, for instance, uses this username for his [X account](https://x.com/VitalikButerin). A search for vitalki.eth on Etherscan brings up the associated address:

&#x20;**Search Etherscan via Google**

In 2023, [Google](https://x.com/nalin/status/1656753830862942208) started displaying the balance of Ethereum addresses (via Etherscan) directly on top of the search results when a user types an Ethereum address in the search bar.
