## Description

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network with its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) currently being the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of value. Open source researchers can use Etherscan to look up data on the Ethereum blockchain, for instance addresses, transactions, smart [contract addresses](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) and more.

&#x20;

By typing in any Ether address in the search bar, researchers get amongst other information an overview of the current balance of the walletâ€™s assets in Ether and USD, the dates when the first and the last transactions were sent and an overview of all transactions.
