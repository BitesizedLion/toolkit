# Etherscan

This transaction was successful and took place in block number 20393430 on July 26, 2024. It was sent from an address ending with 003 to vitalik.eth.URL

## Description

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network with its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) currently being the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of value. Open source researchers can use Etherscan to look up data on the Ethereum blockchain, for instance addresses, transactions, [smart contract](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) addresses and more.

### **Addresses**

By typing any Ether address in the search bar, researchers get amongst others an overview of the current balance of the walletâ€™s assets in Ether and USD, the dates when the first and the last transactions were sent and an overview of all transactions.

### **Ethereum usernames**

Since the Ether address is long and not very user-friendly, there are services (like [Ethereum name service](https://ens.domains/)) that allow users to buy a username ending with .eth. If someone has such a username, researchers do not necessarily need to know the Ether address but can simply search for this name on Etherscan.&#x20;

Some Ethereum fans use their .eth username on social media platforms which can be helpful in terms of tracing digital footprints during open source investigations. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, for instance, uses his vitalik.eth for his [X account](https://x.com/VitalikButerin). A search for this name on Etherscan brings up the associated Ether address:

### **Search Etherscan via Google**

Since 2023 [Google](https://x.com/nalin/status/1656753830862942208) displays the ETH balance (via Etherscan) directly on top of the search results if someone searches for an Ether address:

However, our own tests showed that this does not always work. Sometimes the result comes back with an empty info box:

It is also possible to search for a [username](https://cryptoslate.com/google-adding-ethereum-name-service-data-into-search-results-through-etherscan/) but during our own tests in July 2024, this method seemed to be even less reliable.

### Transactions

Each transaction has its own transaction hash. Searching for this hash on Etherscan brings up an overview of transaction details:

The tool is easy to use but beginners might need some time to learn how to interpret the information it provides.

## Requirements

No requirements.&#x20;

Open source researchers who sign up with an e-mail address can use some additional features like creating a watchlist of addresses and receiving e-mail notifications if transactions from or to those addresses occur.

## Limitations

While some users provide their Ether addresses on social media or other online platforms, it is important to note that most Ether addresses can not be easily linked to a specific person or organization.&#x20;

While transactions are publicly visible via the blockchain, criminals might use [mixer services](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/are-crypto-mixers-legal/) to obscure the original sender and the recipient of payments making it more challenging for open source investigators to deanynomyize transactions. Trying to track down crypto transactions can often lead to dead ends.

## Ethical Considerations

Open source researchers should be careful when using Etherscan since it has become the target of scams and phishing attempts. In 2023, [cloned Etherscan sites](./#phishing-scammers-have-cloned-the-websites-of-crypto-media-outlet-blockworks-and-ethereum-blockchain) were set up to trick users into providing access to their walles. In 2024, [phishing ads](https://crypto.news/etherscan-users-targeted-in-major-phishing-campaign-via-on-site-ads/) were found on Etherscan.&#x20;
