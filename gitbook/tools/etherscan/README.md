## Description

Ethereum is a blockchain-based network with its native cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) currently being the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of value. Open source researchers can use Etherscan to look up data on the Ethereum blockchain, for instance addresses, transactions, smart [contract addresses](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) and more.

### **Addresses**

By typing in any Ether address in the search bar, researchers get amongst other information an overview of the current balance of the walletâ€™s assets in Ether and USD, the dates when the first and the last transactions were sent and an overview of all transactions.

### **Ethereum usernames**

Since the Ether address is long and not very user-friendly, there are services (like [Ethereum name service](https://ens.domains/)) that allow users to buy a username ending with .eth. If someone has such a username, researchers do not necessarily need to know the Ether address but can simply search for this name on Etherscan.&#x20;

Some Ethereum fans use their .eth username on other social media platforms which can be helpful in terms of tracing digital footprints during open source investigations. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, for instance, uses his username vitalik.eth for his [X account](https://x.com/VitalikButerin). A search for this name on Etherscan brings up the associated Ether address:

### **Search Etherscan via Google**

Since 2023 [Google](https://x.com/nalin/status/1656753830862942208) displays the ETH balance (via Etherscan) directly on top of the search results if someone searches for an Ether address:

However, our own tests showed that this does not always work. Sometimes the result comes back with an empty info box:

It is also possible to search for a [username](https://cryptoslate.com/google-adding-ethereum-name-service-data-into-search-results-through-etherscan/) but during our own tests in July 2024, this method seemed to be even less reliable.

## Cost

The tool is easy to use but beginners might need some time to learn how to interpret the information it provides.

## Requirements

No requirements.&#x20;

Open source researchers who sign up with an e-mail address can use some additional features like creating a watchlist of addresses and receiving e-mail notifications if transactions from or to those addresses occur.

## Limitations

\[\[The limitations of each tool should be described. This is important for researchers if they want to decide whether they should invest the time to learn how to use a new tool.]]
