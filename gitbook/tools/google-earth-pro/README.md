## Description

Google Earth is a comprehensive geographic and spatial information tool suite. It allows users to explore a 3D representation of the earth, leveraging detailed imagery, geographic data, and various layers to display geographical phenomena, landmarks, and more. It offers open source researchers satellite imagery in relatively high resolution from various regions around the world, including historical imagery.

#### Versions Available:

* **Google Earth Web**: A browser-based version that allows quick access without the need for software installation. Ideal for collaboration, casual exploration and educational purposes.
* **Google Earth Mobile**: Offers the core functionalities of Google Earth optimized for mobile devices, enabling users to explore geographic data on-the-go.
* **Google Earth Pro Desktop:** The most powerful version offering advanced features (historical imagery, sunlight angle, other planets, video tour recording) for professional users. It is recommended for open source researchers to use this version.

The example below shows a search for Amsterdam filtering layers to display only photo layers on Google Earth Pro Desktop:

## Example Use Cases

* **Geolocation:** Open source researchers use the satellite imagery provided by Google Earth Pro to geolocate photos and videos. &#x20;
* **Investigative Reporting:** Research and investigate environmental changes, urban development, and other phenomena that are best observed from an aerial or geographic perspective.
* **Historical Analysis:** Compare historical satellite images to present-day images to document changes in the environment, urbanization, and other significant transformations.
* **Educational Content:** Produce educational material that explains geographical, political, and social issues in a visually engaging format.

## Cost

## Requirements

* **Web**: any modern web browser and a Google account with an email address.
* **Mobile**: iOS and Android and a Google account with an email address.
* **Desktop**: Windows, macOS or Linux.

## Limitations

While Google Earth is a powerful tool for geographical information systems, it does have some limitations that researchers should consider:

* **Availability of up to date satellite imagery:** While Google Earth Pro offers satellite imagery for free, it is not always very recent and it depends on the location how often it is updated. Open source researchers who need both up to date and high resolution imagery will need to use different providers.
* **Data Accuracy and Currency**: Data in Google Earth may not always be up to date, leading to potential discrepancies with current conditions. Users should verify important information through other sources. For more information see [How accurate is Google Earth’s measurements?](https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-faq/how-accurate-is-google-earths-measurements/)
* **Resolution and Detail**: Image resolution varies across different regions, with some areas having detailed imagery and others being less clear. See [Spatial resolution of Google Earth Imagery](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/11395/spatial-resolution-of-google-earth-imagery).
* **3D Modeling**: While Google Earth provides 3D models of some cities, not all geographical areas have detailed 3D representations. See [List of 3D Locations in Google Earth](https://list.fandom.com/wiki/List\_of\_3D\_locations\_in\_Google\_Earth).&#x20;
* **Data Privacy**: There are concerns regarding the exposure of sensitive locations, potentially compromising privacy and security so some areas are blurred out on Google Eart Pro. See Wikipedia's [List of satellite map images with missing or unclear data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_satellite\_map\_images\_with\_missing\_or\_unclear\_data).
* **Performance**: High-quality imagery and 3D models can be resource-intensive, possibly affecting performance on less powerful computers or devices. Too many _My Places_ locations can for instance cause laggy performance. For more information see [Why is Google Earth so CPU intensive?](https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-pedia/why-is-google-earth-so-cpu-intensive/)
* **Network Dependency**: Google Earth requires an internet connection for access to maps and imagery, limiting use in offline settings.

## Ethical Considerations

In the context of using remote sensing in online open source investigations, several ethical considerations should be considered:

* **Privacy Concerns:** Remote sensing technologies can capture detailed images from space or high altitude, potentially compromising individual privacy. Researchers must balance the public interest with the rights to privacy.
* **Accuracy and Misinterpretation:** Ensuring the accurate representation of data is critical. Misinterpretation of remote sensing data can lead to misinformation, shaping public opinion based on incorrect premises. For more information on how Google tries to ensure accuracy see [here](https://www.wired.com/2014/12/google-maps-ground-truth/) and [here](https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/9-things-know-about-googles-maps-data-beyond-map/).
* **Equity and Access:** The distribution of benefits from remote sensing should be equitable. Journalists should be aware of the digital divide and work towards making their findings accessible to a broader audience.
* **Environmental Impact:** The deployment and maintenance of remote sensing technologies have environmental costs. Ethical journalism considers the ecological footprint of gathering and disseminating information.
* **Informed Consent:** Where possible, obtaining informed consent from those being observed or whose data is being collected, even indirectly, reinforces ethical journalism practices.
* **Cultural Insensitivity:** Avoids the unsolicited mapping or monitoring of culturally sensitive or sacred sites without permission from the concerned communities.
* **Security Risks**: Guards against the misuse of remote sensing technology for malicious purposes, including espionage or cyber-attacks.
