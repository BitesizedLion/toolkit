## Limitations

While Google Earth is a powerful tool for geographical information systems, it does have some limitations that researchers should consider:

* **Data Accuracy and Currency**: Data in Google Earth may not always be up to date, leading to potential discrepancies with current conditions. Users should verify important information through other sources.
* **Resolution and Detail**: Image resolution varies across different regions, with some areas having detailed imagery and others being less clear.
* **3D Modeling**: While Google Earth provides 3D models of some cities, not all geographical areas have detailed 3D representations.
* **Data Privacy**: There are concerns regarding the exposure of sensitive locations, potentially compromising privacy and security.
* **Performance**: High-quality imagery and 3D models can be resource-intensive, possibly affecting performance on less powerful computers or devices.
* **Network Dependency**: Google Earth requires an internet connection for access to maps and imagery, limiting use in offline settings.

## Ethical Considerations

In the context of using remote sensing in online open source investigations, several ethical considerations should be considered:

* **Privacy Concerns:** Remote sensing technologies can capture detailed images from space or high altitude, potentially compromising individual privacy. Journalists must balance the public interest with the rights to privacy.
* **Accuracy and Misinterpretation:** Ensuring the accurate representation of data is critical. Misinterpretation of remote sensing data can lead to misinformation, shaping public opinion based on incorrect premises.
* **Equity and Access:** The distribution of benefits from remote sensing should be equitable. Journalists should be aware of the digital divide and work towards making their findings accessible to a broader audience.
* **Environmental Impact:** The deployment and maintenance of remote sensing technologies have environmental costs. Ethical journalism considers the ecological footprint of gathering and disseminating information.
* **Informed Consent:** Where possible, obtaining informed consent from those being observed or whose data is being collected, even indirectly, reinforces ethical journalism practices.
* **Cultural Insensitivity:** Avoids the unsolicited mapping or monitoring of culturally sensitive or sacred sites without permission from the concerned communities.
* **Security Risks**: Guards against the misuse of remote sensing technology for malicious purposes, including espionage or cyber-attacks.
