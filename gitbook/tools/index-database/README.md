description: A database of remote sensing indices and satellite imaging sensors

# Index Database

## URL

[https://www.indexdatabase.de/](https://www.indexdatabase.de/)

## Description

A searchable web index of remote sensing indices (e.g. metrics for things like vegetation health, land use, water stress) that allows users to search for relevant satellite sensors for a given application. This search may also be inverted, listing the indices it's possible to calculate from a given remote sensing dataset. The index also links different indices to their respective applications, providing references to academic literature demonstrating their usage.

## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Just a web browser.

## Limitations

The index lists sensors, and not the datasets linked to each sensor -- so if you're interested in using the data there is a secondary step of searching for the dataset, which may or may not be freely available and/or accessible. Indices are listed with relevant applications and references to academic literature, however it may take some reading to work out what is right for your application.

## Ethical Considerations

Like any tool related to or making use of remote sensing data, the ethical considerations of IDB relate primarily to accuracy, and the broader systemic effects of developing systems for monitoring/understanding an environment or a social system that are based remotely and don't have a lot to do with the people and ecology there. It's always worth thinking about the basis for claims that are made using these tools.
