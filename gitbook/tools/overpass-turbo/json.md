# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
"name": "Overpass Turbo",
"description":"Overpass Turbo is a web-based tool for querying and visualizing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, aiding in extracting specific information like locations of amenities e.g. schools, hospitals, police stations",
    "url": "https://overpass-turbo.eu/",
    "tags": ["free", "international", "mapping", "environment", "geospatial-information", "geospatial", "geographic-data-analysis", "spatial-analysis", "open-street-map", "osm", "gis", "geographic-information-system", "amenities", "road-networks"]

{% endcode %}

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in dark blue font). Do not change the key names (left side, slightly light blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition". Seperate tags with a comma `,`.

If a tool is completely free to use, include the tag "free".

If the tool is focused on one specific country (or a limited number of them), tag it with the name of the country as well as "international".
