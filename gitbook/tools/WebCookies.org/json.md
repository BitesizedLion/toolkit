# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
  "name": "WebCookies.org",
  "url": "http://webcookies.org/",
  "description": "A website security and privacy scanner that, among many other features (mostly focused on GDPR compliance) aggregates large amount of information about advertiser and analytics identifiers of scanned websites, as well as the /ads.txt files.",
  "cost": "Free",
  "details": " ",
  "tags": [
    "websites"
  ]
}
```
{% endcode %}

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in dark blue font). Do not change the key names (left side, slightly light blue) or any of the other formatting. Every line should end in a comma except the last line. Every key and value should be enclosed in quotation marks. See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition". Seperate tags with a comma `,`.

If a tool is completely free to use, include the tag "free".
