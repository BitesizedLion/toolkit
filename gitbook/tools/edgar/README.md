## Description

EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) is a database of corporate filings maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings contain a wealth of quantitative and qualitative information on every legal entity that issues non-exempt securities in the United States.&#x20;

EDGAR is the primary system for companies and others submitting documents under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the Investment Company Act of 1940.&#x20;

The EDGAR database provides access to corporate information, allowing research of public companies' financial information and operations. It also includes information provided by mutual funds (including money market funds), exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and variable annuities.

Best uses are to track annual reports, top level management of companies, subsidiaries, shareholders, mergers & acquisitions.

Search by keyword, company name, ticker symbol, location or name of an individual.&#x20;

## Limitations

* Users cannot download at once all the documents returned by a text search of the database.
* The data only covers publicly traded companies. For every other company not traded on a stock exchange, research has to be done separately in the business divisions of the Secretaries of State.
* Owing to shifting data tags, it’s extremely cumbersome to create financial profiles for single companies or to perform comparisons between their respective financial metrics.
* RSS feeds are available, but each company is its own RSS Feed, there is no functionality to group several in one place. There are [group RSS feeds](https://www.sec.gov/structureddata/rss-feeds) for the most recent filings, and are updated every 10 minutes during business hours, but the format, output and content of these may change without prior notice.

## Guide

* Public company search - type the company’s name or ticker symbol in the search bar [here](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings). Retrieves filings for a specific company and to find company information — registered name, address, telephone number, state of incorporation, Central Index Key (CIK) number, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, and fiscal year end.
* A more detailed search can be performed [here](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/) - allows search by keywords, company name, stock ticker, CIK number, and individual's name. This search allows to filter filings by date, type and also has a dropdown menu for location (principal executive offices in - the primary location associated with a filing - could be in the US or other countries).
* To search for Mutual Funds, ETF or variable annuities, [go here](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/mutual-funds-search). The left-hand menu has separate searches for mutual funds ([here](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/mutual-funds-search)) and variable annuities ([here](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/variable-insurance-products-search)).  You can use the Mutual Funds tool to also search for ETFs.  You can search for other types of funds as you would search for public companies.
* The largest amount of information is usually in the annual, quarterly and current reports. Some companies also have beneficial ownership filings.&#x20;
* The filings show up like this and can be opened in a `.htm` or `.xml` format.&#x20;

* The `.xml` format is somewhat better, because it contains hyperlinks that lead to every associated document in a specific filing including each submitteed SEC form and exhibit.&#x20;
