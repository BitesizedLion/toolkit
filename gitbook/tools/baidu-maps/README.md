## Description

Baidu Maps is a web-based mapping service provided by the Chinese company Baidu. It offers satellite imagery, street maps, street view (where available), real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle (in beta), or public transportation. Baidu Maps also integrates several search features, allowing users to find detailed information and reviews about businesses and landmarks, including hotels, restaurants, shopping, and more.

One of the key problems Baidu Maps solves is navigation and location-based search within Chinese cities and the broader region. It caters specifically to the needs and preferences of users in China, offering detailed and accurate maps, which are sometimes more up-to-date for this region than those of international competitors.

Features:

* **Search:** search by location name.
* **Language:** Chinese.
* **Distance measure:** measure distance between points in metres.
* **Placemarks**: create shareable placemarks.
* **Streetview:** street view imagery.
* **3D:** visualise areas in 3D.
* **Satellite imagery**

Baidu Maps is available in the following formats:

* Web
* Mobile

The example below shows a search for 北京 (Beijing):

Open source researchers can use Baidu Maps in various capacities:

1. **Geospatial Analysis**: Researchers can use Baidu Maps for in-depth geospatial analyses of Chinese terrain, urban development, and infrastructure changes over time.&#x20;
2. **Cultural and Historical Research**: With its street view feature and detailed map data, Baidu Maps can also serve as a platform for exploring cultural landmarks, historical sites, and architectural evolution in different parts of China.
3. **Environmental Monitoring**: Researchers focusing on environmental conservation and climate change can use the satellite imagery provided by Baidu Maps to monitor deforestation, urban sprawl, and environmental degradation over time.&#x20;
4. **Coverage of Natural Disasters:** Although Baidu Maps does not provide explicit natural disaster coverage its real-time traffic data can be used to identify areas affected.

## Limitations

Baidu Maps, while offering comprehensive mapping services, particularly in China, has several limitations that researchers and developers should consider:

* **Geographical Restrictions**: Its most detailed coverage is limited to China, with less detailed data available for other areas.
* **Language Barrier**: The primary interface and documentation are in Chinese, which can be a barrier for non-Chinese speakers.
* **Access Speed**: International users will experience slower access speeds or need a Chinese IP address to access certain APIs. The Chinese government's [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Firewall) slows traffic plus Baidu's servers [are hosted China, not on a distributed content network (CDN)](https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/736/why-are-sites-like-youku-and-baidu-so-slow-overseas) so the distance to the nearest server is a factor.
* **API Rate Limits**: There are limitations on the number of API requests that can be made. Although we cannot verify what these are they will impact the use of the API.

## Ethical Considerations

When using Baidu Maps, it is important to consider various ethical implications:

* **Privacy Concerns**: Like many mapping services, Baidu Maps gathers user data, which raises questions about data privacy and protection. This is particularly significant for the Baidu browser and on [mobile apps](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/02/privacy-security-issues-baidu-browser/).
* **Censorship and Content Control**: Being a Chinese company, Baidu Maps may adhere to government censorship laws, affecting the type of content available or omitted. More information [here](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/3.htm).
