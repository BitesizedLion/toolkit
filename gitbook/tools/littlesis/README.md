## Description

LittleSis is a wiki database that houses information from a range of online sources on powerful individuals and organisations in the public and private sectors in the Unites States. It seeks to show the relationships between those individuals and organisations, with the aim of helping users to track relationships (e.g. donations to politicians and political action committees, also called PACs, and board memberships). The goal is to help the user to follow the money and discover connections between those that hold public and private sector power.

According to their [website](https://littlesis.org/database), LittleSis includes data from "government filings, news articles, and other reputable sources". It is maintained through automatic updates and manual edits. Links to data sources are provided.

Here's an example of a person's page:

LittleSis includes an '[Oligrapher mapping tool](https://littlesis.org/oligrapher)', which can be used to create graphical representations of power networks based on the data housed in LittleSis:
