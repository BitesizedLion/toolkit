## Description

Telegago is a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) that facilitates Open Source Investigations on Telegram by focusing searches on public content available within the platform. A CSE allows for the creation of a search environment tailored to specific internet domains or content types. Telegago leverages this feature by using custom search operators to conduct precise queries on Telegram's domains such as t.me, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the search results. This tool is particularly useful for researchers who require access to publicly shared information on Telegram without needing an account on the platform.

**Guide on How to Use Telegago**

1. **Input Search Term:**
   * Open the Telegago search engine page.
   * Type your desired search term into the search box. You can enhance the specificity of your search using Google search operators. For example:
     * **Exact match:** Use quotes to search for an exact phrase or term, e.g., `"European Parliament"`.
     * **Exclude words:** Use the minus sign to exclude certain words from your search, e.g., `European Parliament -AfD` to find information about the European Parliament excluding articles mentioning the AfD party.&#x20;
2. **Get Results:**
   * Click the search button to execute your query.
   * Telegago will display a list of results from public Telegram content that match your specified query. These results are confined to Telegram’s domain, focusing on user profiles, channels, and groups relevant to your search terms.
3. **Join Groups or Channels (Optional):**
   * If you identify a Telegram group or channel of interest in your search results and wish to join it, you can use tools such as [Bellingcat's Telegram Group Joiner](https://github.com/bellingcat/telegram-group-joiner).
   * This tool facilitates automatic joining of specific Telegram channels or groups by utilizing direct links found in your search results.

## Limitations

Telegago only indexes publicly accessible information on Telegram, so any content set to private or deleted before indexing won't be available. The results depend on the effectiveness of the search terms used.

## Ethical Considerations

Users must consider the privacy implications of accessing and using data from Telegram profiles and groups. It's important to comply with legal standards and respect privacy rights during OSINT activities.
