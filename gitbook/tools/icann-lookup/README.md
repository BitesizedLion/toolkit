# ICANN Lookup

## URL

[https://lookup.icann.org/](https://lookup.icann.org/)

## Description

If you run the URL of a website through this tool, you might be able to find out the name, and sometimes the mailing address, of the company or individual who registered it.&#x20;

Often, and especially for larger organisations, this information is redacted on request. Many companies and individuals use domain registration companies like Domains by Proxy LLC or GoDaddy Inc. to provide a further layer of anonymity.  &#x20;

Nevertheless, this is an easy and free check that is well worth trying if you come across a website with interesting information and would like to know the source or possible author of that information.
