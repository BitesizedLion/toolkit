## Description

Intelx lets you search email addresses (and other inputs) in its database of information from the darknet, document sharing platforms, whois data, public data leaks and others. You can expect to find associated accounts, names, IP addresses, passwords, dates of birth, etc.&#x20;

&#x20;In the example below, Intelx finds a particular email address in a leak of Twitter and Chegg. The twitter one shows info on names, screen names, followers and the creation time. The Chegg database shows email addresses and their passwords.

## Requirements

\[\[Information on the requirement for using a tool, for instance, API key, e-mail address etc.]]

## Limitations

\[\[The limitations of each tool should be described. This is important for researchers if they want to decide whether they should invest the time to learn how to use a new tool.]]

## Ethical Considerations

Strong ethical considerations as you are looking into leaked data of users. Depending on the ethical and legal threshold of your work, you may or may not use it. Asses if researching a person of interest in the leaked database is worth it, if public benefit is great, does the end justifies the means?&#x20;

If yes, do not use the data to hack into an account. OSINTers have used intelx before to find associated accounts - e.g. from an email address finding twitter account, to find more info on a research subject - e.g. date of birth.&#x20;
