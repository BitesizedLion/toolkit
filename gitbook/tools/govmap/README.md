## Description

GovMap was developed by the Israeli government to provide the public with detailed geographical information about Israel. The web-based platform features a wide range of data, including property boundaries, urban planning and zoning information, as well as infrastructure details like roads, utilities, and public institutions. It allows users to search, view, and analyze the available geographical data.

The platform offers a centralized source of geographical information that can support a variety of users - from government officials and urban planners to real estate professionals and the general public. Open source researchers can obtain up-to-date information on land use, planning proposals, and other data necessary for researching topics like development, investment etc. in Israel.



_Naturally, the portal, which contains such diverse information from various sources at different levels of updating, may contain certain internal contradictions. In these cases, the very presentation of the differences in information will combine information sources (the various government ministries) with the need to correct and adjust the information within uniform boundaries to reduce these contradictions. In this context, see the section Legal warnings._

While GovMap is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a broad audience, new users may require some time to familiarize themselves with its various functions and data layers to fully leverage its capabilities.

## Requirements

* **Web**: any modern web browser.
* **API**: email address to register.

## Limitations

While offering an interface that provides access to various geographical data related to Israel, GovMap does have certain limitations that researchers should consider:

* **Resolution and Detail**: The level of detail and resolution might not be sufficient for all research purposes, especially when highly detailed or localized data is needed.
* **Update Frequency**: The data on GovMap may not be updated in real-time or on a very frequent basis. This can affect the use of the tool for time-sensitive research.
* **Accessibility**: While the platform is designed to be user-friendly, users who are not familiar with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tools or who do not speak Hebrew might find it challenging to navigate and utilize the platform to its full potential.
* **Data Availability**: Not all datasets are available for every area within Israel, and there may be restrictions on accessing certain types of data due to privacy laws or national security concerns.
* **Performance**: High traffic volumes or large data queries can sometimes slow down the platform, affecting the user experience.

Researchers should weigh these limitations against their specific needs to determine whether GovMap is the right tool for their project.

## Ethical Considerations

When using Israel's GovMap, several ethical considerations should be accounted for:

* **Privacy:** The detailed geographical data available might inadvertently expose sensitive information, impacting individual privacy. It's crucial to balance the utility of open data with the protection of personal privacy.
* **Bias in Data Representation:** The way information is collected, updated, and displayed could introduce biases, affecting how areas are represented and potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes.
* **Accessibility:** Ensuring that GovMap is accessible to users with disabilities and non-Hebrew speakers is essential to avoid excluding significant user groups from accessing public data and participating in informed community planning and decision-making.
* **Data Security:** As with any platform hosting extensive databases, securing the data against unauthorized access and ensuring it is not used for malicious purposes is paramount to protect national security interests and privacy.
* **Ethical Use of Data:** Researchers and users should consider the potential implications of how the data obtained from GovMap is used, particularly in contexts that could impact communities or the environment negatively.
