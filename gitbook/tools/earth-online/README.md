## Description &#x20;

The European Space Agency's Earth Online is a portal dedicated to providing a wealth of information on ESA's Earth observation activities and datasets. It serves as a comprehensive platform for scientists, researchers, and the general public interested in Earth science and environmental monitoring. Users can access up-to-date satellite imagery, data from Earth observation missions, and a range of tools designed to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of environmental data. Earth Online also features news, educational resources, and detailed mission information, making it a useful resource for anyone looking to understand our planet's dynamics and changes.

### Use Cases for European Space Agency's Earth Online

The European Space Agency's Earth Online portal offers a broad array of use cases, including but not limited to:

* **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracking changes in climate, land use, and natural habitats over time.
* **Disaster Response and Management:** Providing critical data for responding to natural disasters like floods, wildfires, and earthquakes.
* **Agricultural Analysis:** Assisting in the monitoring of crop health, forecasting yields, and managing agricultural resources more efficiently.
* **Oceanography and Marine Sciences:** Supporting the study of ocean currents, sea surface temperatures, and marine ecosystems.
* **Urban Planning:** Aiding in the planning and development of sustainable urban environments through land use analysis and infrastructure planning.
* **Educational Resources:** Serving as a tool for educators and students in the fields of earth sciences, geography, and environmental studies.

These use cases highlight the versatility of the Earth Online portal in supporting a wide range of scientific research, educational, and applied environmental management activities.

## Requirements

* Web: any modern web browser (individual tools will have specific requirements documented inline)

## Limitations

* **Data Availability**: While ESA's Earth Online offers extensive datasets, certain historical data or high-resolution imagery may not be readily available due to the limitations of past missions or data retention policies. See the individual dataset fro more details.
* **Learning Curve**: New users may find the interface and array of tools challenging to navigate without prior experience in satellite data analysis or familiarity with similar platforms.
* **Access Restrictions**: Some datasets require specific permissions or qualifications for access, limiting use for certain research or educational purposes. See [How to Access Data](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing\_the\_Earth/How\_to\_access\_data) for more information.
* **Processing Power**: Advanced data analysis and processing tasks demand significant computational resources, which may not be feasible for all users. Different tools will have different processing requirements see the individual tool's documentation.
* **Update Frequency**: The update intervals for some datasets may not meet the needs of users requiring real-time or near-real-time information. Different datasets will have different update frequency see the individual dataset's documentation.

## Ethical Considerations

In the context of using remote sensing in online open source investigations, several ethical considerations should be considered:

* **Privacy Concerns:** Remote sensing technologies can capture detailed images from space or high altitude, potentially compromising individual privacy. Journalists must balance the public interest with the rights to privacy.
* **Accuracy and Misinterpretation:** Ensuring the accurate representation of data is critical. Misinterpretation of remote sensing data can lead to misinformation, shaping public opinion based on incorrect premises. Different datasets and tools will have different accuracy issues, see the individual dataset's documentation.
* **Equity and Access:** The distribution of benefits from remote sensing should be equitable. Journalists should be aware of the digital divide and work towards making their findings accessible to a broader audience.
* **Environmental Impact:** The deployment and maintenance of remote sensing technologies have environmental costs. Ethical journalism considers the ecological footprint of gathering and disseminating information.
* **Informed Consent:** Where possible, obtaining informed consent from those being observed or whose data is being collected, even indirectly, reinforces ethical journalism practices.
* **Cultural Insensitivity:** Avoids the unsolicited mapping or monitoring of culturally sensitive or sacred sites without permission from the concerned communities.
* **Security Risks**: Guards against the misuse of remote sensing technology for malicious purposes, including espionage or cyber-attacks.

## Guide

The platform acts as a guide to the tools it hosts, the main way of discovering tools is through the search interface: [https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/search?category=Tools+and+toolboxes\&tools\_type=analysis\&sortby=RELEVANCE](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/search?category=Tools+and+toolboxes\&tools\_type=analysis\&sortby=RELEVANCE) from here filters for the different tool types (Analysis, Processing and Visualisation) can be applied. &#x20;

The example below shows the default analysis tools search interface:
