## Requirements

There are no requirements to use this tool, and no e-mail address is requested.\
**Using with no account:** Explore features such as deforestation, fires, land cover, land use, biodiversity, and weather data from 2001 on (in most of the regions).\
\
However, researchers who want to optimize their research can create an account, sign up for alerts in an area of interest, analyze data, and receive email notifications when new alerts are available.\
**To create an account:** After providing an email, you can use generic information on contact and affiliation.

## Limitations

Like all data from satellite imagery, we can not say that the data is 100% accurate.

## Ethical Considerations

There are minimal ethical considerations, as it is configured with a combination of sources (below). Still, consider the limitations when using the data to take action.\
