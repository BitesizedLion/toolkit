## Description

Use Google Lens to identify objects or locations that are visible in an image. This can be useful if you want to geolocate an image, or find out more information about the objects, landmarks or vegetation in a photograph in order to better understand its contents. Primarily a mobile phone application, it can also be used in the Chrome browser.&#x20;

### Using the Google Photos mobile application&#x20;

Open a photograph in the Google Photos mobile application and click the Google Lens![](<.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)  icon at the bottom of the image.&#x20;

### Using Google Photos in the browser&#x20;

Right click any photo you come across while browsing the Internet using Google Chrome and click 'Search with Google Lens'. Results will be shown on the right.&#x20;

## Requirements

You need the Google Photos application on your mobile phone if you want to search an image in your gallery. Otherwise, you can use the Google Lens plug-in in Google Chrome.

## Limitations

Google Lens is getting more sophisticated with time, but it doesn't always work, especially if a physical landmark or object is very generic. It is, however, a very useful first port of call and can potentially  save you time.

## Ethical Considerations

Make sure you analyse the search results critically and cross-reference these with other sources of information to ensure your findings are accurate. This can help stem misinformation and prevent wrong information from spreading. Do not use copyright images without permission.&#x20;
