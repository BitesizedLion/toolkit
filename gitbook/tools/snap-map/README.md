## Description

Snap Maps is a feature of Snapchat that allows users to post images and videos that are automatically geolocated to a city, town, or place. Snap Map posts appear as hot spots on a heat map. The warmer the color of the hot spot means that there is a higher quantity of Snap Maps being posted there. Users can view a map of the world and click anywhere near a hot spot to view posts in that area.&#x20;

Snap Maps posts on the heat map may be viewable for [different](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012271195796-How-to-Submit-to-Snap-Map) amounts of time, but can last for up to six days. Some last for only a day or two.

Some specific places, such as museums, restaurants, and universities, appear automatically on the heat map. Users may also zoom in on the map to find these locations and view public posts that user have geotagged to that specific place. These posts can go back several months.

Snap Maps is useful when a researcher knows a specific event is occurring and wants to have a more on-the-ground understanding of the event. Snap Maps may be used to find more precise geolocations of an event. A Snapchat user posted a video of armed clashes in Jenin on May 21, 2024.

&#x20;While the user may not know where specifically in Jenin the clashes occurred, a user can use cues from the video to find a more precise location for the event.

Snap Maps is also a good place to start for investigations on human networks in specific locations. Snap Map posts are linked to a specific Snapchat user, which other users can click on to view the users' public profile. The public profile includes the users' Snapchat name, username, a description, and other public posts from the user. The user who posted the video of the clashes in Jenin has several other public posts attached to their profile, including images of armed fighters with militia paraphernalia and a funeral service.

## Requirements

Users must access Snap Maps through a Snapchat account, which requires an email or phone number.

## Limitations

Snap Maps is currently unavailable in Cuba, North Korea, Turkey, and Ukraine.

Snap Maps does not allow the user to filter posts by date, time, or a specific Snapchat user. This can make sorting through Snap Map posts very time consuming.

Snap Maps is not available on desktop, which can make it difficult to archive information. However, users may screen record while using Snap Maps to archive posts. Snap Maps was previously available on desktop, and previous instructions on how to archive Snap Maps posts from 2018 is available [here](https://twitter.com/AricToler/status/1054805284802228224).&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

Snap Map can contain graphic or explicit content unless other users report the post to Snapchat or the post is removed by Snapchat's automated monitoring [systems](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012271195796-How-to-Submit-to-Snap-Map). Users can view posts on Snap Maps while their location services for Snapchat are off, or while keeping their location on the app private from their Snapchat friends in "Ghost Mode." Snapchat may still have access to the users' location in Ghost Mode, according to Snapchat's [policy](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/15051407058068-How-My-AI-Uses-Location-Data) on location data, however.&#x20;
