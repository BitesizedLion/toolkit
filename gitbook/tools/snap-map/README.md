## Description

Snap Maps is a component of Snapchat in which users can post stories that are automatically geolocated to a specific city, town, or place. Snap Map posts appear as hot spots on a  heat map. The warmer the color of the hot spot means that there is a higher quantity of Snap Maps being posted there. Users can click anywhere near a hot spot to view posts in that area.&#x20;

Snap Map posts do not last forever. Snaps that are posted to Snap Map may be viewable for [different](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012271195796-How-to-Submit-to-Snap-Map) amounts of time. Some last for only a day or two, while others can be seen for much longer. Posts on the heat map can last up to six days.&#x20;

Users can also zoom in on the map to locate specific places, such as museums and restaurants, and view public posts that posters have geotagged to that specific place. These posts can go back several months.

Snap Maps is useful when a researcher knows a specific event is occuring and wants to have a more on-the-ground perspective of the event, including by geolocating events to a specific location. A Snapchat user posted a video of clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militia fighters in Jenin after Israeli forces launched a two-day operation there on May X, 2024.

Snap Maps is not available on desktop, which can make it difficult to archive information. However, users may screen record while using Snap Maps to archive posts. Snap Maps was previously available on desktop, and previous instructions on how to archive Snap Maps posts from 2018 is available [here](https://twitter.com/AricToler/status/1054805284802228224).&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

Snap Map can contain graphic or explicit content unless other users report the post to Snapchat or the post is removed by Snapchat's automated monitoring [systems](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012271195796-How-to-Submit-to-Snap-Map). Users can view posts on Snap Maps while their location services for Snapchat are off, or while keeping their location on the app private from their Snapchat friends in "Ghost Mode." Snapchat may still have access to the users' location in Ghost Mode, according to Snapchat's [policy](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/15051407058068-How-My-AI-Uses-Location-Data) on location data, however.&#x20;
