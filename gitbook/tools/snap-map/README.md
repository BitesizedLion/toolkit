## Requirements

## Limitations

The limitations of each tool should be described. This is important for researchers if they want to decide whether they should invest the time to learn how to use a new tool.

## Ethical Considerations

Snap Map can contain graphic or explicit content unless reported or automatically taken down by Snapchat. Users can view posts on Snap Maps while turning off location services for Snapchat or keeping their location on the app private from their Snapchat friends in "Ghost Mode." Snapchat may still have access to the users' location in Ghost Mode, according to Snapchat's [policy](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/15051407058068-How-My-AI-Uses-Location-Data) on location data, however.
