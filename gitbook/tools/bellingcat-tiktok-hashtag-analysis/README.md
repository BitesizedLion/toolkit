# TikTok Hashtag Analysis

## URL

[https://github.com/bellingcat/tiktok-hashtag-analysis](https://github.com/bellingcat/tiktok-hashtag-analysis)

## Description

Command-line interface tool that downloads posts and videos from TikTok for a given set of hashtags over a period of time. Users can create a growing database of posts for specific hashtags which can then be used for further hashtag analysis. It uses the [TikTokApi](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api) Python package to download the posts and uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the videos. Also provides basic analysis features, such as identifying and visualizing the most common co-occurring hashtags for a specified hashtag.
