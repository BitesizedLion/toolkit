## Description

GeoSpy is an online platform that uses neural networks to estimate the geographic location of photographs by analyzing visual features such as vegetation, architectural styles, and contextual clues. Users can upload a photograph, and the tool will provide an estimated location of city, state, and country, a marker on a map of the location, as well as a short block of text explaining its reasoning for choosing that location.

Currently, you just need to upload an image file to the website, and no subscription is required for use. As with any AI model, results are not foolproof and should be further corroborated, but the tool can be useful for getting initial clues about an image's location.

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

GeoSpy currently adopts a freemium model. In a footer on the results page of image identification, the developers specify that the free version of the tool is in beta, and GeoSpy Pro is recommended for any professional use cases.

GeoSpy also offers free (and tiered pricing) access to their API [here](https://api.geospy.ai/).

## Ethical Considerations

GeoSpy's [Privacy Policy](https://api.geospy.ai/privacy-policy) specifies the extent and use of its data collection; the tool collects data that includes but is not limited to your IP address, browser information, details about your mobile device if accessing the tool via mobile, and more. This data may also be shared with Graylark's business partners, affiliates, and others.

GeoSpy's [API FAQs](https://api.geospy.ai/#faqs) specify the processes undertaken to ensure user privacy which include techniques such as no storage of images, anonymisation of data, and transient image processing on a secure GPU.

**Note that the GeoSpy API is a different model than the free GeoSpy tool. No privacy information specifically regarding the free tool is available.**

Be aware when handling sensitive information.
