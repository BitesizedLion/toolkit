## Description

GeoSpy is an online platform that uses neural networks to estimate the geographic location of photographs by analyzing visual features. Currently, you just need to upload the file to the website, no subscription is required. As with any AI model, results are not foolproof and should be further corroborated, but the tool can be useful for getting initial clues about the image location or confirming any meta data available.

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

GeoSpy currently adopts a freemium model. Notably, the developers specify that the free version of the tool is in beta, and GeoSpy Pro is recommended for any professional use cases.

GeoSpy also offers free (and tiered pricing) access to their API [here](https://api.geospy.ai/).

## Level of difficulty

## Limitations

## Ethical Considerations

GeoSpy's [Privacy Policy](https://api.geospy.ai/privacy-policy) specifies the extent and use of its data collection; the tool collects data that includes but is not limited to your IP address, browser information, details about your mobile device if accessing the tool via mobile, and more. This data may also be shared with Graylark's business partners, affiliates, and others.

GeoSpy's [API FAQs](https://api.geospy.ai/#faqs) specify the processes undertaken to ensure user privacy which include techniques such as no storage of images, anonymisation of data, and transient image processing on a secure GPU.

**Note that the GeoSpy API is a different model and architecture than the free GeoSpy tool.** No privacy information specifically regarding the free tool are available.

Be aware when handling sensitive information.
