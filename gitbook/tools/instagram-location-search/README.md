## Description

Instagram Location Search is a Python-based command-line tool that open-source investigators can use to get geolocation leads on Instagram’s platform.  Users can also use the tool to search for photos or videos of an incident under investigation.&#x20;

Instagram Location Search is a tool that helps users find Instagram location IDs near specified coordinates. [It uses Instagram’s API to retrieve location data](https://github.com/bellingcat/instagram-location-search).&#x20;

### What Problem Does It Solve?&#x20;

When looking for media within a particular location, searching with just an address or the name of a location on Instagram can be confusing, especially for popular spots. [The problem is that Instagram suggests an abundance of location options for a single place (See video at 1:11).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equWt9Dq5b0)&#x20;

This could mean the investigator will have to manually compile a list of all those possible locations and then potentially sift through the individual location tags to look for media.&#x20;

Caption: This is an example of a popular location. However, the challenge is that when a user tags the image, various location suggestions appear.&#x20;

1. This tool solves the problem of efficiency. Instead, Instagram Location Search casts a broader net by compiling all the location tags near a set of coordinates along with their respective links to Instagram’s Explore page.
2. This tool also solves the problem of ease of exporting the data in various output formats that are tailored to the individual needs of the investigator.&#x20;
