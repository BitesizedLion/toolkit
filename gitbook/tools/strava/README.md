## Description

Strava is a fitness app that allows users to publish various kinds of exercise activities on a map using GPS data. Activities are automatically mapped out and key metrics are recorded. Researchers may use Strava to track a users' activities, gather location data, and understand patterns of movement in real time.&#x20;

1. **Profile Analysis:**
   * Username and Bio: Analyze users' profile information. Look for any clues or personal details that could be useful in identifying the individual.
   * Activity History: Review the user's activity history to understand their routines, frequented locations, and types of activities they engage in.
   * Groups and Clubs: Search for clubs or groups on Strava to find an area or person of interest. Users can filter their search by location and Sport Type.
2. **Activity Details:**&#x20;
   * Date and Time: Note the timestamps of activities to establish patterns of behavior or routine.
   * Location: Use the map feature to pinpoint specific locations where activities have taken place. Users may upload public photos or videos on their routes. This can include routes, starting points, and endpoints. Note that users' may hide their start and end points up to one mile.
   * Activity Type: Determine the types of activities the user engages in, which can provide insights into their interests and habits.
   * Heat Maps: View a weekly and yearly heat map of users' activities in any location around the world. Filter the heatmap by activity type, length of route, difficulty, surface, and elevation. The yearly heat map is updated every month, and the weekly heatmap is updated every 24 hours.
3. **Segments and Leaderboards:**
   * Explore segments where the user has recorded activities. Look at their rankings on leaderboards to understand their performance relative to others in the area.&#x20;
4. **Connections and Networks:**
   * Identify who the user follows and who follows them. This can reveal connections, affiliations, or relationships that might be relevant to the investigation.
   * Join relevant clubs or groups the user is part of to gather more information about their social circles or interests.
5. **Map Overlays and Data Export:**
   * Use map overlays to visualize activity routes and identify potential points of interest.
   * Export data for further analysis, such as aggregating activity timelines or creating visualizations of movement patterns over time.
6. **Combine with Other Sources:**
   * Integrate Strava data with other sources of information, such as social media profiles, geotagged posts, or public records, to build a more comprehensive profile of the individual.

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

Strava has an unpaid and paid subscription. The unpaid subscription is sufficient for an OSINT investigation because it still allows users to view Strava's heat maps, view groups and clubs, and discover or add other Strava users.&#x20;

The paid version is geared towards maximizing a users’ personal workouts and goals. In the United States, subscribers [pay](https://www.strava.com/pricing) $11.99 per month or $79.99 per year. Subscribers on a Family Plan pay $139.99 per year.

## Level of Difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

Users must create a Strava account using an email address to find other users and log activities. Users may use Strava on desktop or download the Strava app.&#x20;

The global heatmap is available to the public, but only registered Strava users may view the weekly heat map or zoom in to street-level details of activity on the global heatmap.

## Limitations

Using Strava for OSINT research has several limitations:

1. **Privacy Settings**: Many users have their profiles set to private, limiting the visibility of their activities and personal information to non-connections.
2. **Accuracy of Data**: While Strava provides detailed activity data, the accuracy of this data can vary depending on factors such as GPS signal strength, device used, and how activities are recorded (e.g., manual entries vs. GPS-tracked).
3. **Incomplete Data**: Not all users record all of their activities on Strava. Some may only use it sporadically or for specific types of activities, which can lead to incomplete or skewed data.
4. **Reliability of Metadata**: Metadata associated with activities (such as timestamps, locations, and descriptions) may not always be accurate or up-to-date.
5. **False or Misleading Information**: Users can manipulate their profiles or activity data, either intentionally or unintentionally, leading to false or misleading information for OSINT purposes.
6. **Limited Historical Data**: Free access to historical data on Strava is limited, and more detailed historical data requires a premium subscription. This can restrict the depth of analysis for long-term trends or patterns.
7. **Different Data on Desktop vs Smartphone:** Using Researchers may find more detailed heat map data using desktop rather than for S desktop for Strava the Strava heatmap is better on a desktop. The desktop allows users to search a global weekly heatmap, which is all user activity that is set to "public" from the past 12 months. The weekly heatmap is updated every month.

## Ethical Considerations

Strava displays user-generated content, which may include location data and personal information shared by individuals.&#x20;

Users may opt out of the aggregate data usage in their privacy settings. Activities with the privacy setting "Only You" or “Followers” are excluded from the heat map automatically. Strava also exclude all portions of activities hidden using a users' map visibility settings.
