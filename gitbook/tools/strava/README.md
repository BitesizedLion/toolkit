## Description

Strava is a fitness app that allows users to publish various kinds of exercise activities on a map using GPS data. Users can follow other users and view other Strava users’ workout information, including where they have exercised in real time. This is because users can record their workouts using their smartphone or GPS-enabled device. Activities are automatically mapped out and key metrics are recorded. Users can also view a global heat map of activities from users over the past year in any location.

\
Researchers may use Strava to track a users' activities, gather location data, and understand patterns of movement.&#x20;

1. Profile Analysis:

* Username and Bio: Start by analyzing the user's profile information. Look for any clues or personal details that could be useful in identifying the individual.
* Activity History: Review the user's activity history to understand their routines, frequented locations, and types of activities they engage in.
* Groups and Clubs: Search for clubs or groups on Strava to find an area or person of interest. Users can filter their search by location and Sport Type.

1. Activity Details:

* Date and Time: Note the timestamps of activities to establish patterns of behavior or routine.
* Location: Use the map feature to pinpoint specific locations where activities have taken place. This can include routes, starting points, and endpoints.
* Activity Type: Determine the types of activities (e.g., running, cycling, swimming) the user engages in, which can provide insights into their interests and habits.
* Heat Maps:&#x20;

1. Segments and Leaderboards:

* Explore segments where the user has recorded activities. Look at their rankings on leaderboards to understand their performance relative to others in the area. This can provide context on their competitiveness and engagement with the community.

1. Connections and Networks:

* Identify who the user follows and who follows them. This can reveal connections, affiliations, or relationships that might be relevant to the investigation.
* Join relevant clubs or groups the user is part of to gather more information about their social circles or interests.

1. Privacy Considerations:

* Respect privacy settings and do not attempt to access private information that is not publicly available.
* Be aware that users may intentionally or unintentionally disclose sensitive information through their activities. Exercise discretion in handling such data.

1. Map Overlays and Data Export:

* Use map overlays to visualize activity routes and identify potential points of interest.
* Export data for further analysis, such as aggregating activity timelines or creating visualizations of movement patterns over time.

1. Combine with Other Sources:

* Integrate Strava data with other sources of information, such as social media profiles, geotagged posts, or public records, to build a more comprehensive profile of the individual.

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

Strava has an unpaid and paid subscription version. The unpaid subscription is sufficient for an OSINT investigation because it still allows users to view the global heat map and discover or add other Strava users.&#x20;

The paid version is geared towards maximizing a users’ workout goals and includes personal fitness data and tracking. In the United States, subscribers [pay](https://www.strava.com/pricing) $11.99 per month or $79.99 per year. Subscribers on a Family Plan pay $139.99 per year.Level of difficulty

## Requirements

Users must create a Strava account using an email address to find other users and log activities. Users may use Strava on desktop or download the Strava app.

The heatmap is available to the public, but only registered Strava users may view the weekly heat map or zoom in to street-level details of activity on the global heatmap.

## Limitations

Using the Strava heatmap is better on a desktop. The desktop allows users to search a global heatmap, which is all user activity that is set to "public" from the past 12 months.&#x20;
