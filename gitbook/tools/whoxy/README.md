## Description

With Whoxy there are several options to find information on domain names. Single searches are free and do not require an account or a fee. For multiple searches an API is available.&#x20;

The search box on the top right of the page has a little arrow which signals the possibilities. Entering a domain name in the Whois Lookup, for instance whoxy.com, results in a page which shows multiple panes of information.&#x20;

The largest pane offers the basic information, for instance when the domain was registered, when it was updated and when it will expire. This basic info is available in whois format, but also RAW, JSON and XML.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see who owned Whoxy.com in the past.

To the right of the basic information there is a smaller pane listing similar-named domains which are linked. There is a button to view all.

_Note that the use of the Whois History search box leads to the same information at the bottom of the page without the need of scrolling down._&#x20;

Whoxy offers 4 options for reverse Whois.

On Owner Name: when a name is entered results are returned which show all domain names that are linked to that name, including the domain name itself, the registrar, the creation date, the date it was updated and the expiry date. When the results contain a large number of results, a subset is shown with the message to use the API.

On Company Name: input of a complete company name results in all domains which are linked to that company name.

On Email address: input of a valid email address results in all domains which are linked to that email address. This might be used as a pivot point.

On Domain Keyword: when a keyword is entered, for instance "iPhone", the results show all domains which have that specific keyword in the domain name. When the results contain a large number of domain names, a subset is shown with the message to use the API.
