# JSON

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json
{
    "name": "Tool Name",
    "description": "A brief one-line description.",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
}
```
{% endcode %}

Keep the codeblock updated with accurate information. Only edit the **values** (words to the right of the `:` on each line, in light blue font) and do not change the key names (left side, slightly darker blue). See below for an explanation of each line.&#x20;

## name, description, url

These are self explanatory and not likely to change. They should match the information on the main tool page.

## tags

This list of tags will determine which category pages the tool appears on. Tags should be lowercase with dashes between words and no spaces: e.g., "facial-recognition".

If a tool is completely free to use, include the tag "free".
